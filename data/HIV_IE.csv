"Posted:, Fri May 09 1997 IST",Drug cocktail to wipe out HIV will take 3 years," , LONDON, May 8: Drugs meant to wipe out the HIV virus may have to kill every single infected cell in the body before all risk of Aids is gone - and that could take more than three years, researchers have said.,The studies are disappointing news for HIV-positive patients who dared hope for a cure last year when researchers announced that triple-drug therapy, while very unpleasant and expensive, could virtually obliterate the virus.Two separate studies published in the science journal Nature show that although drug cocktails knock the HIV virus back to almost undetectable levels, they do not kill it all off straight away.,Robert Siliciano of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore and colleagues looked at the cells that HIV lives in - the CD4 immune system cells - in 14 HIV-infected volunteers.,They were specifically looking at ""memory cells'', which are responsible for the immune system's ability to ""remember'' and respond to infection months or years after first exposure,.""The good news is there aren't very many of these cells,'' Siliciano said in a telephone interview. ""The bad news is they can persist for a very long period .'',His group found HIV persisted in about 0.05 per cent of all the resting, or temporarily inactive, CD4 cells.""These are the cells that are the long-term reservoir of the virus,'' Siliciano said. ""They are not affected by drugs - drugs only affect the virus during the replicative cycle.''But there was evidence HIV lurked inside the body, waiting for its chance to come into its own again. Siliciano's work indicates that HIV need only hide in a very few CD4 cells - maybe just one.These cells are extremely hard to find and it would be almost impossible to test patients to see if they were harbouring any CD4 cells infected with HIV. ""The only thing you can really do is be patient and see what happens,'' he added.,In a second study, Dr David Ho of the Aaron Diamond Aids Research Center at Rockefeller University in New York and colleagues did try to measure how long the virus stayed around.,Ho's group has been following eight HIV-infected patients who are on the triple drug therapy for nearly two years. It was this study that first led to the findings that the cocktail approach worked.,Levels of the virus in the blood drop by 99 per cent in the first two weeks of cocktail treatment. As Siliciano's group's findings illustrate, what is important to know is how long it takes to get rid of that last one per cent. Ho's group used mathematical models to predict how long the virus could live in this suppressed state. ""We estimate that 2.3 to 3.1 years of a completely inhibitory treatment would be required to eliminate HIV-1 from these compartments,'' they wrote.,""To eradicate HIV-1 completely, even longer treatment may be needed because of the possible existence of undetected viral compartments or sanctuary sites.,""Given the high cost and toxicity of prolonged combination therapy,'' they added, ""new strategies must be developed to facilitate the extinction of those viral `embers' that could rekindle the infection.''

"Posted:, Mon Aug 04 1997 IST",Testing HIV-positive is not the end of the road," , August 3: A skit on HIV-AIDS is in progress. But 26-year-old Suhasini is not interested. All that occupies the mind of this mother of two, is the fear of losing her government job. ""My husband succumbed to AIDS a year ago. Last week, blood tests were carried out on all the employees. If they find out I'm positive, the men will blame me. I'll lose my job,"" she says timidly.,Suhasini is one of the many HIV-positive individuals who along with their families and friends, met and interacted at the Sarvodaya Hospital, Ghatkopar on Sunday morning. The get-together was organised by the HIV/AIDS information and guidance centre (founded by Drs Prakash and Aruna Bora in 1993) in collaboration with Lions Club of Bombay Hill Top and AIDS Research & Control Centre.,During the course of this programme, Suhasini was informed that it is illegal for her employer (especially if it is a government organisation) to discriminate between or even test employees for HIV. A medical officer with the BEST and a representative of a pharmaceutical firm also spoke about the relevant policies of their companies.,In stark contrast with Suhasini, is one of the organisers of the programme, Lata Batwal (her real name). Time and again, Lata has spoken about her HIV-positive status on a platform ""in an attempt to combat the stigma and the false sense of shame that people bear,"" she says. Lata's husband died of AIDS and is raising her three children through acute financial difficulties. Lata has a part-time sales job and propagates the concept of family planning on weekends.,Through the numerous instances quoted by patients, it emerged that a large chunk of medical fraternity indulges in discrimination. ""Forget treating us, nurses don't even smile at us. Such hostility hurts,"" said a patient. Lamenting the lack of support from surgeons and gynaecologists, Dr Bora said, ""The number of doctors treating AIDS is increasing, but when it comes to surgery or child-birth, most doctors are reluctant to operate on HIV- positive individuals."",Sushama Suryavanshi, a social worker working in Kamathipura spoke of a sex worker who was to undergo a tonsillitis operation. ""Once the doctor discovered she is HIV- positive, he flatly refused to operate. Since then, she and her child have disappeared,"" says Suryavanshi. Surma, yet another HIV-positive young widow, spoke about the problem of her mother-in-law who refuses to eat the food cooked by her. An ailing B Prasad described how he is being shunted between his village in UP and Mumbai as nobody wants an AIDS patient in their midst.,On the other hand, there is Ramesh who nursed his brother for four months before he succumbed to AIDS. There are the ageing Shahs who looked after their son and daughter-in-law who died of AIDS. Says Kanta Shah,""My husband used to be on his toes all the time. I too used to promptly cook whatever my son wished to eat at that time. My other sons, daughters-in-law and their children were all involved in caring for them."",As Dr Bora says, ""With rising hospital costs, it is home care that is of prime importance."",(Patients' names have been changed to protect identities.)

Over 500 students from various South African countries study in the city. These students are required to undertake the HIV test at the time of admission to first year courses and only on testing negative are they admitted.,When the Ugandan girl tested HIV positive she was immediately served a ""Leave India"" notice. However the girl suddenly disappeared without giving any information to the Foreign Students Registration cell of the police.,Early this week, police learnt that the girl was back in Aurangabad. Keeping a close watch on places where she could take shelter, the police finally found her in a house, in the Himayatbagh locality here.,The Depty Commissioner of Police, Aurangabad, K M Syed, said, a special escort accompanied the girl till Mumbai, from where she was sent to Uganda.,Earlier, the girl disclosed to the police that she was in Jhansi, for the last one year.,This is the second time in the last few years that a foreign student was deported for testing HIV positive.

"Posted:, Sat Nov 22 1997 IST","World Vignettes -- ""Weapon"" to counter HIV virus"," , WASHINGTON: It may take a virus to kill a virus, say researchers who have made a biological weapon that seeks out cells infected with HIV. In laboratory experiments at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Centre, scientists have shown that a harmless virus coated with special proteins will search out cells infected with HIV and then lock onto the cell surfaces. Dr James A Hoxie, senior author of the study in the journal science, said that the hunter virus could be loaded with a biological weapon that would attack HIV inside infected cells and, thus, control the Aids virus. The study was published on Friday.,Bad vodka,MOSCOW: Authorities in the east coast city of Nakhodka have burned 16,000 bottles worth of bootleg vodka in an ongoing effort to crack down on moonshine, a news agency reported. The homemade vodka, confiscated mostly from private traders and underground distilleries, was doused with gasoline and set alight at a waste plant on Thursday, the Itar-Tass News Agency said. Authorities issue regular warnings about the dangers of bootleg vodka, which results in hundreds, perhaps thousands of deaths each year in Russia. But illegal vodka, which is far cheaper than officially sanctioned vodka, remains hugely popular.,Caged girl,CHILTON (US): A seven-year-old American girl shut in a dog cage in a cold, dark basement was discovered when her 11-year-old brother, coatless and barefoot, went to a police station for help, authorities said. The girl's father, Michael Rogers, could be sentenced to up to 80 years in prison if convicted on eight charges of physical and mental abuse of the family's four children. Her mother, Angeline, faces up to 55 years on eight counts. They were jailed on Wednesday on a bail of US $ 5,000. Investigators found the girl in a 61-cm-by-43-cm wire cage. She was thin but otherwise healthy.

"Posted:, Wed Dec 17 1997 IST",800 per cent rise in HIV positive cases," , NAGPUR, Dec 16: Health minister Dr Daulatrao Aher, who was grilled in the Legislative Assembly for failure of the Health Department in effective implementation of the AIDS awareness drive, told the House that there has been an alarming 800 per cent rise in HIV positive cases in the State in a short span.,The State has the dubious distinction of topping the HIV infected and AIDS affected patients. Moreover, the rate at which the number of patients with HIV positive blood is growing, is alarming. It is a clear indication of the failure of the State Government, members alleged even as the Minister tried to defend his department saying that it is a global phenomenon.,The issue was raised by Anees Ahmed (Cong) and several others through a call-attention notice. They expressed concern over the steep rise in number of HIV positive cases detected in Nagpur city and elsewhere in the State. In reply, the minister informed the Assembly that a survey conducted last month revealed eight AIDS cases in Nagpur city. A surveillance centre detected 106 cases in 1996 and 166 this year. It is feared that all of them will develop into full grown AIDS cases in another eight to ten years.,Members demanded that blood tests should be conducted on a mass scale so as to detect the patients. The existing system of sample survey does not give a true picture. They also wanted to know about the financial and technical assistance from the Central Government and World Health Organisation (WHO).,Those raising supplementaries included Dr Madhavrao Kinhalkar and Prabha Rau (Cong), Sohail Lokhandwala and Nawab Malik (SP) and Kirit Somaiya (BJP).In reply, Dr Aher said he also favoured a mass blood testing drive. Pointing out that he had raised the demand at a meeting of state ministers, he said demand was turned down by the Central government and WHO .

"Posted:, Sat Jan 03 1998 IST",1 in 500 bottles of safe blood HIV +ve," MUMBAI, January 2: One out of every five hundred bottles of voluntarily donated blood, screened for HIV and marked safe, can give you AIDS. This shocking revelation made in a study conducted recently is likely to pose fresh problems for the state health department, which is struggling to comply with the Supreme Court's ban on professional blood donors.,The study, a joint effort of the Aids Research and Control Centre (ARCON), J J Hospital and the Directorate of Health Services, has revealed that one out of every 500 bottles of voluntarily donated blood in Mumbai was HIV infected. This fact came to light when samples which had tested negative in the ELISA test were put through the Reverse-Transcriptase-Polymersase-Chain-Reaction (RTPCR) test. A person tests HIV positive in the ELISA anti-body test only three months after infection. However In this three-month window period the risk of the infection spreading is high. There are three categories of blood donors: The highest risk category is that of the professional donors who, the Supreme Court has directed, should be identified by blood banks and checked. The second category is replacement donors who are usually considered safe because they are the relatives and friends of patients., But, with professional donors masquerading as replacement donors, the risks cannot be eliminated. The safest category is considered to be that of the voluntary donors.,However if, as the ARCON study says, one in 500 bottles of blood is HIV infected then taking the base figure of one lakh transfusion per year, it can be calculated that about 200 individuals could contract HIV through blood transfusion this year alone from these `safe' donors. ""There is a great risk of AIDS spreading through blood transfusions. The infection spreads fast and a lot of infected individuals are sero-negative (infected by HIV, but do not test positive in the anti-body test),'' Dr Subhash Hira, the director of ARCON, said. The solution he offers is to put all HIV negative blood through the P24 antigen ELISA test at an additional cost of Rs 30 per sample. In this test, the virus is detected just five to seven days after infection., Another solution is to be a lot more circumspect while prescribing blood transfusion to patients. ""A lot of doctors advise blood transfusion in cases of dehydration or anaemia. This should be stopped. Blood transfusion should be resorted to only when absolutely essential,'' Dr Hira said. What now worries the experts is that after the ban on professional donors, the demand for volunteers will only go up. At a meeting on December 23, all state health officers in charge of blood donation drive were told that they would soon have to fix new targets for voluntary blood collection. The aim of the state government of course is to ensure surplus blood. But after the study Aids Research and Control Centre no one knows if that is such a good thing.

"Posted:, Wed Feb 11 1998 IST",Maharashtra has highest number of HIV cases in India: IHO chief," PUNE, FEB 10: India is the hot spot for HIV and Maharashtra is leading in the number of HIV positive cases, secretary general of the Indian Health Organisation (IHO) Dr I Gilada said.,Speaking at the international seminar on complimentary medicine in AIDS organised by Rashtriya Shikshan Mandal here on Sunday, Dr Gilada said managing HIV patients involved providing supportive care to help increase the patients' life span, symptomatic treatment and managing opportunistic infection as there is no perfect anti-HIV drug available at present.,He stressed the need for reducing the costs for managing HIV positive patients and adopting a holistic approach to prevent the spread of the disease.,There is an urgent need for recognising the right of the child in the womb of an HIV positive mother, to ensure that it is born without carrying the infection, he said, adding that a safer way to prevent transfer of HIV infection from mother to child was to use available medicines.,Emphasising that patients should not besegregated, Dr Gilada said that treatment and proper counselling can help the patients to a large extent. Monitoring of test laboratories all over the country is also necessary, he said.,Health education, partner reduction and behavioral change, condom production and its increased use, prenatal screening and case finding, partner notification, sentimental surveillance of population at risk, early diagnosis and prompt treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, providing AIDS awareness to sex workers, public awareness, alcohol control and a strict control on the operation of quacks, he said, are some of the steps to prevent the spread of the disease.

"Posted:, Thu May 28 1998 IST",HIV+ to HIV- : A route to adoption," May 27: In an age where HIV is the buzzword for social ostracism by the illiterate and educated alike, there's a ray of hope: Children who are born HIV positive but turn negative a few months later are being adopted.,In most cases, children born to HIV positive mothers test positive during the first three months. But within about 15 months, many of them test HIV negative. This phenomenon is restricted to infants.,The ELISA and Western blot tests used to detect HIV indicate the presence of antibodies of the HIV virus. Offspring of HIV positive mothers are bound to show positive in these tests, as the antibodies are transmitted to them from the mother. But this doesn't always mean the HIV virus is present in the infant's body.,Dr Ashish Pathrikar, pediatrician attached to Jaslok Hospital explains that as the child grows, he develops his own antibodies and those transmitted from his mother slowly disappear. That's why, after a few months, the infant tests negative. ""But if the HIV virus is present, thechild will always test positive,'' he says.,Tejasvini (name changed), a cherubic 18-month-old at Mahalaxmi's Bal Asha Trust is on her way to join her new parents in Norway. Tested every three months for HIV antibodies, Tejasvini would test positive every time. She finally tested negative six months ago and was put up for adoption. Payal, the first such child to be adopted from Bal Asha by a Mumbai-based family, is now eight. During the last seven years, at least ten such children from Bal Asha, Family Service Centre and Indian Association of Promotion of Adoption and Child Welfare (IAPA) have been adopted. ""When we began getting HIV positive children in the mid-80s, we wouldn't have dared to talk about it. But attitudes have changed and the bottomline is never to withhold any information from those who wish to adopt,'' says Madhavi Hegde Karandikar (MSW), honorary secretary of Bal Asha Trust.,Karandikar insists all children be tested for HIV soon after birth. She says, ""A positive child won't be able totransmit the HIV virus to people around him easily. But if he's exposed to individuals with tuberculosis or any other infection, it would be dangerous for him.'' IAPA president Kaumudi Telang advises parents to consult a doctor to understand what HIV-negative means. ""The period before the child tests negative is crucial for us. We place children in foster families after advising them on how the child's clothes should be washed separately in case he bleeds,'' says Telang.,HIV can be transmitted from the mother to the infant during pregnancy or post-birth, due to breast-feeding. Doctors are divided on whether an HIV-positive mother should breast-feed her baby. ""In developed countries, HIV positive mothers don't breast-feed. But in developing countries, the risk of an infant dying of malnutrition on being denied breast milk is higher. And as the risk of transmission through breast-milk is low, we advise them to continue feeding,'' explains Dr Srikant Balsubramanyam, a pediatrician at Gurunanak hospital.Though children who turn HIV-negative are normal, not all parents would accept them with open arms. Children like Tejasvini are lucky. But for three and five-year-olds like Shubha and Rasika, who still test HIV positive, and always will, the future seems uncertain. Unless the ray of hope spreads even further.

"Posted:, Mon Jul 27 1998 IST",State to participate in trial of controversial anti-HIV drug,"    NEW DELHI, July 26: India will launch clinical trials of the controversial anti-HIV drug ""AZT"" now found useful in preventing transmission of the deadly virus from pregnant women to newborns.,Confirming launch, this year, additional director general of the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) J V R Prasada Rao said institutes are already being identified for the trials in Pune, Mumbai, Chennai, Pondicherry, and the states of Manipur and Kerala.,AZT is useless as a cure because of the rapidity with which HIV develops resistance to it. But the drug can temporarily reduce viral load in the mother's blood, giving the newborn a chance to come into the world uninfected.,""It is criminal to use AZT as a cure for HIV because it could lead to rapid development of multi-drug resistant strains,"" said Dr Durgadas Dasgupta, consultant at NACO and one of India's foremost experts on the virus which causes AIDS.,AZT causes several undesirable side-effects, which make exposure of the foetus and the newborn to thedrug somewhat risky.,Putting the newborn on AZT reduces its chances of HIV transmission through breast milk by about fifty per cent, Dasgupta said. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which will monitor the AZT trials, recently brought out a complete set of guidelines for the testing of the drug in this country.,Results of trials on AZT already conducted in several countries and released at the 12th world conference on HIV/AIDS at Geneva last month indicate that benefits far outweigh the risks especially when combined with Caesarean deliveries.,However, activists have sounded caution. ""The experience with trials of other imported drugs have not been encouraging -- we don't want this to be another case of third world women ending up as guinea pigs for multi-national drug companies,"" said Brinda Karat, general secretary of the All-India Democratic Women's Association.,Mira Shiva, a doctor who is a well-known advocate of rational drug-use and member of the Voluntary Health Association of India(VHAI) said several ayurvedic drugs are known to have the effect of reducing the viral load in HIV patients in a more natural and safe way.,Rigorous tests conducted at a laboratory in Pune have shown that an ayurvedic drug popularised by Dr T A Majeed drastically reduces viral loads of HIV patients to a point where they show HIV-negative on the commonly available P24 antigen test.,Convener of the Joint Action Council, Kannur (JACK) Purushottaman Mulloli said the drug should not be introduced into this country simply because the programme is being funded by the World Bank which has just released an additional 200 million dollars to NACO.,Mulloli warned that several multi-national drug companies which specialise in the rather expensive anti-HIV drugs were anxious to penetrate the Indian market and maximise their profits.,According to NACO, costs to a pregnant woman who has to take AZT through the last trimester would be less than Rs 10,000 -- but that could put it out of the reach of many from thepoorer sections, especially if they have to pay for Caesareans as well.,Shiva thinks that the vast funds being made available by the World Bank to fight Aids in India -- which could go all the way up to 800 million dollars-- would be better spent tackling poverty which drives many women to prostitution in the first place.,But what Shiva, Karat and Mulloli find most objectionable is unaccountability. ""In the past when imported drugs have failed, authorities have attributed it to genetic differences in the Indian population,"" Shiva said.

In replacement of blood and blood donated by the professional donors, the prevalence of HIV positive has also increased from .51 per cent to .56 per cent and .31 per cent to .34 per cent respectively during the past two years. The status report for this year has not been complied so far.,According to report, the prevalence of HIV positive, which was 0.47 per cent in 48,653 units blood collected by the Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS) in 1996 has increased to .74 in 41,442 units of blood in 1997. Out of 696 units replacement of blood last year by Kasturba hospital, its prevalence was found highest (1.43 per cent) followed by Rajiv Gandhi hospital (1.41 per cent) in 4,586 units of blood generated by the hospital.,In 1996, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (Main) collected 5,198 units blood from voluntary donors and 13,550 units from replacement. The percentage of HIV positive was reported 0.23 and .47 per cent respectively. In 1997, the percent of prevalence, however, decreased to 0.0812 per cent and 0.33 per cent respectively despite increase in the total generation of blood 8,600 units (voluntary) and 13,312 units from replacement.,In Delhi, besides 15 government blood banks, there are 11 private blood banks, responsible to collect blood from voluntary donors and replacement of bloods.

Maintaining at par status with the government blood banks, the private individuals donated 82,443 units followed by 48,653 units by the Indian Red Cross Society blood banks. The contribution of professional donors was 77,708 units.,If status report is to be believed, after the Supreme Court order banning the professional blood donors, there was nominal increase in the total stock of blood, both in the government and the private blood banks in 1997. Out of total 2,71,793 units blood generated in 1997, the voluntary donors donated 45,648 units, while from replacement, it was 1,67,399 units. Quantity of blood being generated by the Red Cross, however, declined from 48,653 units in 1996 to 41,442 units in 1997, report said.,According to State Blood Transfusion Council (SBTC), which was set up to monitor the blood transfusion services and to maintain quality control in the city, the annual requirement of blood in Delhi varies from 3.5 to 4 lakh units per annum.

The irony highlights the fact that the human immuno-deficiency virus has now breached anatomical limits by worming its way into the human psyche, actually frightening patients into taking their lives, experts say.,More than the debilitating effects of the disease itself, patients who take their own lives are often unable to cope with the horror of having contracted the disease, experts reveal.,An Indian Health Organisation (IHO) report revealed five HIV-infected patients under their treatment committed suicide during the week. Kishor Vedak was the first to hang himself in the early hours of December 1. A 27-year-old Ratnagiri resident committed suicide on December 4. He was to get married three days later.,A 29-year-old hotelier from central Mumbai killed himself on the night ofDecember 5 after attending to the day's work. A married woman from Rajasthan, who was being treated at a clinic at Grant Road, ended her life by jumping into a well, and a man who was being treated for tubeculosis after having contracted the HIV virus committed suicide on December 6.,According to IHO secretary general Dr I S Gilada, the organisation's `Helpline' has received at least five calls from the homes of those victims who committed suicide during AIDS week, demanding to know if the house should be fumigated after the death of a HIV-infected family member. ""Other questions were: Should the body be wrapped in a plastic bag before being cremated? Is it all right to keep the dead in the house for a long time?'' Gilada added.,""IHO figures could only be the tip of the iceberg. Most HIV-related deaths could have gone unnoticed because to a layman the cause might seem to be tuberculosis, dysentry or a host of common diseases,'' Dr Gilada pointed out. ""But it doesn't imply that all those in the sexuallyactive age group of 20 to 40 who committed suicide in the last few days were HIV positive,'' he said.,Dr J K Maniar, consultant, Skin and VD department at GT Hospital, said a high-profile awareness campaign during a particular week creates mental restlessness among HIV-infected patients. There is an alarming rise in upset patients calling up the doctor for counselling.,According to Dr Maniar, most of the campaigners know little about AIDS and few have ever interacted with an HIV-positive person. Inadequate knowledge about the patient's psyche adds to the problem, Maniar added.,Studies have revealed that an estimated one per cent of the country's population of 955 million is HIV infected, 2.5 to 4 per cent of the city's 15 million population is hit by the disease and the prevalent rate among pregnant women is about four per cent.

He has remained free of HIV for two years.,""I don't see why others cannot become the Berlin Patient,''said Dr Franco Lori, head of the Research Institute for Genetic and Human Therapy at Georgetown University in Washington.,Lori's team is one of a few exploring the idea that it may be possible to wean people away from the demanding regimen of AIDS medicines without actually curing them of their infections. Lori presented his findings yesterday at the sixth conference on retroviruses and opportunistic infections.,Some physicians are sceptical. They fear AIDS patients wholearn of these attempts will stop taking the drugs on their own -- with potentially deadly consequences. ""My concern is that this will be overplayed,'' said Dr Robert Schooley of the University of Colorado.,""It sounds good to patients. Who wouldn't want to stop treatment? But the real question is whether you can change the immune response. I worry patients will stop therapy. Whenever that happens, in my experience, the virus comes roaring back.'',Lori calls the approach stop and go. The idea: treat people with standard aids drugs until all signs of HIV vanish from the bloodstream. Withhold the medicines until the virus returns. Then give the drugs again. Keep repeating the cycle until eventually the virus never comes back.,It probably won't be eradicated entirely, so the theory goes, but the body's immune defences will be able to keep it from the explosive growth that is HIV's killing trademark.,Lori has tried the approach so far on three patients. While it's still too soon to know whether it willwork, Lori finds the first few weeks' results promising. The interval before the virus returns is lengthening. Furthermore, he said that in more aggressive experiments on monkeys, the only practical nonhuman substitute for AIDS research, the approach seems to keep the virus at bay for good.

It will only create an atmosphere of fear in an environment where HIV patients are stigmatised and ostracised.'',He said there was a slender chance of infection between inmates of a shelter home. If the government is really concerned about them it could provide education on sexual health, Gordon added.,""HIV tests are not 100 per cent accurate,'' he said. ""At least three tests are needed for accurate results. The first round may even show a non-infected person as HIV-positive and vice versa,'' he said.,NGOs have also protested against the move of the Delhi Social Welfare Ministry to have an HIV test drill in shelter homes for women and children.,Protesting against the move by the Social Welfare Ministry, Joint Action Council Kannur, an NGO, said that if the government is really interested in controlling the spread of HIV, it should educate or counsel people on how to avoid risk behaviour. HIV tests alone are enough to stigmatise the tested people, it said in a statement here.,If the ministry fears spread of infection through inmates of shelter homes, it is equivalent to admitting the possible sexual exploitation of the inmates, it said. Joint Women's Programme, another NGO here, said that no cure has been discovered for AIDS and hence testing people for it is as good as ostracizing them. It called for a suitable rehabilitation package before any tests are done.

This observation was made by the experts delivering lectures on HIV infections at a continuing medical education programme of Indian Medical Association, here yesterday.,The experts on the subject, Dr Ajay Wanchoo, additional professor of internal medicine and Dr Archana Sud, assistant professor of the same department at PGI, Chandigarh, highlighted the methods of diagnosis and treatment of HIV patients and occupational hazards to the health care workers and preventive aspect of the disease. They said that India and Thailand are leading the world in number of HIV positive cases. Highest number reported in India is in Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. The prominent mode of HIV transmission is through heterosexual contact at 74.6 per cent, followed by intravenous drug use (8.8 per cent) blood transfusion and blood product infusion (6 per cent). In Punjab 12 per cent of the patients acquired HIV through blood infections. It is common among drivers and migrant workers (10 per 10,000).,Dr Archana Sud gave guidelines regarding risks of HIV infection to health care workers such as doctors and paramedical staff attending on patients and handling blood transfusion services. She stressed the need to take chemoprophylaxis with anti-retroviral drugs. In the event of deep injury suffered by any health worker attending on any suspected case of AIDS and such a worker must be regularly tested for HIV over a period of six months. She stressed the need for regular precautionary measures to be taken by health care workers while handling blood and other samples.,Chairman of the session, Dr A. S. Sekhon, professor and head of department of preventive and social medicine, Government Medical College, Patiala, said that although AIDS virus does not remain active in dead tissues, it has been reported that the virus remains alive for a few hours in small muscles of hands and fingers and bones of the patients who have died due to AIDS. The doctors performing postmortem autopsies on such cases must use protective measures to save themselves from getting the infection.,Co chairperson of the session Dr Kulbir Kaur, head of the transfusion department of Rajindra Hospital said that now it is mandatory to screen all units of blood for HIV. Every unit is screened before issued for transfusion.,Dr S. S. Sidhu, principal, GMC Patiala and Officiating Director, Research and Medical Education, Punjab, lauded the role of IMA at national and local level in highlighting and creating awareness about health care system. Sidhu who is a patron of IMA said that he will provide all help to IMA in its endeavour to continue serving the public health care delivery system and continuing medical education to doctors.,Dr O. P. S. Kande, Hony Secretary, IMA, Patiala, said that 50 per cent of the new HIV infections are now occurring among the young people in the age group of 10 to 24 years because they are more vulnerable to HIV than others due to uninformed curiosity.

"Posted:, Tue Mar 30 1999 IST",Club clears myth linking AIDS & `HIV positive',"    NAGPUR, March 29: Imagine the anguish and agony of a poor truck driver who is informed by his doctor that he is suffering from AIDS and has only a few years to live.,Imagine the tormented state of mind of his pregnant wife who is told she too has been tested HIV Positive, would most certainly develop AIDS and would certainly pass on the infection to her child.,The wife is told in case she wants to give birth to the child, she will have to take very strong doses of medicines around 100 capsules a month for three months as a precautionary measure for the health of the child. And the cost of the medicine -- well, Rs 5000 per bottle of 100 capsules!,The shattered couple read about the HIV Positive People's Club in Nagpur and entered into correspondence with the club members. Now they have a new vision about HIV Positive and AIDS. They have realised how the blood test report for HIV can be faulty or misleading or how there is no concrete proof yet to link HIV Positive with AIDS. The couple has gone back totheir home in Mumbai now with a positive state of mind that they too can lead a normal life sans expensive medicines. They were all praise for the club and its president Dr Shantilal Kothari.,Talking to The Indian Express here, the couple said they were shocked, ashamed and devastated by the news that they had AIDS and their child will also be affected. They were going to be parents nine years after their marriage. Abortion was thus out of question. But how could they spend Rs 5,000 per month on medicines, when their monthly income was almost half of that?,The couple are not the only people who have been given a ray of hope by the HIV Positive People's Club. Many others through correspondence or personal touch have managed to clear their misconception about the disease.The world across voices are being raised by scientists, doctors, research scholars and microbiologists. A number of journals, books written by eminent scientists have proved there is no link between HIV Positive and AIDS.According toKothari there is no conclusive evidence yet in the world linking HIV Positive to AIDS. The fear of HIV and its supposedly connection to AIDS can be conquered with rational thinking. That's what the HIV Positive Club is trying to tell people.

"Posted:, Mon Mar 15 1999 IST",HIV tests spark debate,"    SURAT, March 14: The medical fraternity has reacted strongly to the attempt by the city police to subject commercial sex workers to HIV test, saying forcible tests violate the recommendations of the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO).,The NACO recommendation says, ""No person can be compelled to take HIV tests. Mandatory tests can be done only on orders from the competent authority.'' The reaction comes in the wake of the police plan to drive out commercial sex workers. Chakla Bazaar Hatao Samiti (CBHS) is agitating for the same demand for the past six years.,The police have raided Chakla Bazaar, located in the heart of the city and surrounded by four schools and four religious places, and arrested over 60 sex workers, including customers, over the last fortnight. All of them were taken to the New Civil Hospital (NCH) and subjected to HIV tests.,The tests have angered the medical fraternity, who say they are ""violation of human rights as the patient's consent is a must.'' ""Once declared positive, the HIV carrier might face social boycott. Moreover, the tests could be faulty and a single Elisa test is not sufficient proof to establish one's HIV status,'' says associate professor of Preventive and Social Medicine (NCH) Dr Pradip Gupta.,""Our intention is to highlight the risk the people run because of existence a redlight area,'' says police commissioner Kuldip Sharma while justifying the tests. ""We want to use the reports -- which we are yet to get -- to back up our drive legally,'' he says.,When contacted, Dr R P Patel, in-charge HIV Testing Centre, refused to divulge the test results.,A senior doctor, asking anonymity, says, ""The police is doing a futile exercise. Even if they are declared HIV carriers they will continue the trade elsewhere.'',The Surat Municipal Corporation in association with Dr Gupta's department is running Sexual Health Intervention project in the area, which will be affected if CSWs are shifted. Project manager Dr N R Mehta admits the police raid has affected the project.,According to a survey conducted by Dr J K Kosambiya six years ago, 18 per cent sex workers were HIV positive. The total number of women involved in the flesh trade is said to be 600.,And this is why, points out police commissioner, it is easy to rehabilitate at least 200 of them. ""Efforts are on to rehabilitate at least those willing to come out of the hell. The police are co-ordinating with various agencies, including NGOs, to find an effective solution. Since the number of prostitutes in Surat is small compared to Mumbai and Calcutta, it is easy to rehabilitate them,'' Sharma says.

"Posted:, Mon Apr 19 1999 IST",HIV+ve look to clarify fine-print on marriage,"    MUMBAI, April 18: A and C make for quaint names. But these are the identities of two HIV positive individuals who have moved the Bombay High Court urging it to declare that they too, like any other normal individual, have a right to marry and lead normal lives. ,In this, the duo, backed by the legal team of the `Lawyers Collective' are in effect seeking to challenge a recent Supreme Court judgement, which held that a HIV positive individual's right to marriage remains suspended till he or she is HIV positive, which - as of today - would mean forever.,The petition, currently being heard by the division bench of Justice N J Pandya and Justice S S Parkar and presented by senior advocate Anand Grover, argues that marriage is a fundamental right within the meaning of the right to life and liberty protected under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. Can it at all be abridged? If an HIV positive individual wanting to marry, discloses his/her situation to the spouse and marries only on obtaining his/herconsent, would there be any criminal or civil consequences on the individual?,Social ostracism, isolation, loss of job and human dignity. Along with the social stigmas faced by an HIV positive individual, the fraternity now faces its most challenging legal hurdle. The Supreme Court case of `Mr X v/s Hospital Z', which decided the marriage issue, itself exposed the vulnerability of an HIV positive individual in the present social system. X was an assistant surgeon in Nagaland who had accompanied a local patient to Madras for an operation in June 1995. The operation was cancelled due to shortage of blood and eventually X was asked to donate blood. His blood samples were taken and tested.,In August 1995, X, unaware of his HIV status, proposed marriage to one Y which was scheduled for December. However, the hospital in Madras subsequently, going against all medical ethics and norms disclosed the HIV positive status of the groom to the bride's family. The marriage was called off, X was ostracised by thecommunity and hounded off Nagaland. Hurt that the information which was required to be kept secret was disclosed illegally, X filed for damages against the hospital in the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.,The case eventually landed up at the Supreme Court's door where a division bench of Justice S Sagir Ahmed and Justice B N Kirpal rejected his claim that the hospital should have maintained confidentiality. The bench held that ""the proposed marriage carried with it the health risk to an identifiable person who had to be protected from being infected.'' On similar lines, the bench also held that ""the right to marry cannot be accepted in absolute terms ...as long as the person is not cured of the communicable venereal disease, the right to marry cannot be enforced through a court of law and shall be treated to be a ""suspended right.'',In their petition at the Bombay High Court, the petitioners have not disputed that a person reported to be HIV positive is bound to disclose his status tohis spouse to obtain valid consent to sexual intercourse. A failure to do so, has also been held in some jurisdictions to be a valid ground for divorce. But, it has pointed out that a person could marry another with full knowledge of the other's HIV positive status.,Quoting numerous cases and judgements in the US and Canada it has urged that a doctor has to maintain confidential the medical status of hispatients.,If he were allowed to start revealing the medical facts of his patients, the faith reposed in the medical profession would suffer. Even in the somewhat delicate HIV scenario, it has been long recognised that the prevention of transmission at a social level is best advanced by protecting the rights of the HIV positive individual.,As far as the collection of blood samples are concerned, the petition points out that blood units can be tested in an unlinked and anonymous manner, and the blood bank need not know or disclose the identity of the person whose blood is tested positive.,In the end, amarraige and a healthy emotional relation is cited as one of the important stress busters for an individual undergoing intense psychological trauma on being tested HIV positive. Considering that a full blown AIDS occurs for 85 per cent of the individuals, only 18 years after testing HIV positive, it has been argued that a mere HIV positivity does not make anyone unfit to perform any of his social or economic functions.,Stressing that it is the society and the system that has to change to accommodate the HIV positive, the petitioners have pointed out that safe sex with condoms between discordant couples (where one is HIV negative) reduces transmission risk to nil. Also with artificial insemination, an HIV couple can have children who are not HIV positive.

The much-hyped programme of the State AIDS cell has nothing other than platitudes to offer Arun.,Though Dr Belicita, the State AIDS programme officer, talks about awareness camps, counselling and free medical treatment, none of these seems to have filtered down to those most in need of such help. Arun family's experience calls into question the efficacy of the programme.,A resident of Kavalakulam in Perumbazhuthoor panchayat in Neyattinkara taluka, Arun's descent into the heart of darkness began when his nine-year-old sister Anjana, who suffered from frequent bouts of fever and tuberculosis, was diagnosed as being HIV positive. Tests revealed that he and his mother were also carriers.,It is presumed that his mother, Prasannakumari, might have contracted the virus from his father, Chandran, who committed suicide six years ago. Anjana succumbed to her illness on September 2 and her mother on October 10, last year. Since then Arun has been in the care of his aunt, Vasanthi Devi, a primary school teacher.,Though Vasanthi Devi says that awareness camps were held in the area and Arun's school by the primary health centre after Anjana's illness came to light, it was too late to help Prasannakumari.,Deprived of information, Arun's mother preferred to isolate herself as she feared that she might infect someone through her mere presence.

"Posted:, Tue May 18 1999 IST",Anti-Aids drug trial proposed on kids of HIV+ mothers,"    MUMBAI, May 17: The gynaecology department of the JJ Hospital has handed in a controversial proposal to test the effects of anti-AIDS drugs on babies born to HIV positive mothers. According to the proposal, sumbitted in January this year, a combination of AZT and 3TC drugs are to be administered to the infants when they turn a month old in the Out Patient Department (OPD) by their parents. The ethical committee of the hospital has rejected the report in a recent meeting, but the department may soon re-sumbit a fresh proposal.,AZT and 3TC, which will be tried out for their efficacy in reducing the infection, are still pending approval with the Drug Controller of India. They are to be administered in three month doses by the parents, and will be tested for their impact when the babies turn 18 months old. The proposal has identified three hospitals for holding the trials: JJ and Cama and Albless in Mumbai and Sassoon Hospital in Pune. Babies born to HIV infected mothers have a 33 per cent chance of being HIVpositive; thus the trials will be conducted on all babies born to such mothers in these wards.,The project was initiated a year ago by the gynaecology department of JJ and BJ Medical College, Pune in collaboration with the John Hopkins University, USA; the latter will also supply the drugs for the trial. The project's clinical director is Dr KE Bharucha, who is also the professor and head of the gynaecology department at JJ. The other doctors include Dr PM Bulakh, professor of biochemistry department, BJ Medical College, Dr PJ Dalal, professor of microbiology department, JJ, and Dr MA Phadke, professor of paedriatics department, BJ Medical College.,Senior doctors at JJ have raised serious objections to the proposed trial, pointing out that not only is it highly unethical, but is also likely to jeopardise the lives of the infants. The effects of a combination of AZT and 3TC are not known even abroad, pointed out a member of the ethical committee. A similiar project, the `Petra Study' in the US, hadrecently conducted trails on newborn infants, but its interim report is yet to be published, added sources.,A doctor working with AIDS patients also pointed out that it is highly risky to conduct such trials in the OPD. If infants develop complications during the trial, panicky parents could rush them to pedeatricians who may be completely in the dark about the drugs or their effects, he pointed out. There is every possibility that the drugs may result in temporary or even permanent damage to the child, he added.,Sources also claimed that the project is based on incorrect data that tends to give an inflated estimate of the incidence of HIV infection among infants. A study conducted by doctors at Cama and Albless in 1998 showed an incidence of 1.47 per cent of HIV among infants. This project, however, has taken the estimated incidence to be 4.25 per cent, which is a gross inflation, sources said.,Confirming that the hospital's ethical committee had rejected the project in a meeting held last week, JJDean Dr AC Mohanty said he was never appraised of the details of the trial. A member of the ethical committee also revealed that a project report submitted misrepresents designations by doctors who are on the project. Dr Bharucha has been mentioned as the `chair' of the department at one place, and as `director' at another, although no such posts exist. Further, the report puts down Dr PJ Dalal as the dean of JJ Hospital since 1993, when in fact, she has only been the acting dean for a couple of days on the few ocassions when the dean was on leave, sources said.,Dr Bharucha said she respected the decision of the ethical committee, but stressed that the report might be resubmitted afresh. But she refused to reveal details of either the costs or duration of the project, claiming that the matter was between the department and the state government.,Dr Bharucha admitted that although results of tests being conducted in the area have not yet been published, the doctors on the project would like to see theresults of these drugs on HIV positive babies. The issue of misrepresentation of designations is being sorted out with hospital authorities, she added.,Included in the children's rights as declared by the Geneva convention of the United Nations is the right to not be subjected to any research and experimentation. Even parents of a child can give consent only for accepted modes of treatment and not for trials where toxic drugs are being used.

The first of such mobile clinic was inaugurated by the Mumbai Districts Aids Control Society (MDACS) on Friday.,The mobile clinic will focus on areas with high-risk groups vulnerable to HIV infection and where construction of permanent clinics are not possible. It will target commercial sex workers (CSWs) and their clients in redlight areas and truckers travelling along the national highways. Two more mobile clinics will be put into service by next month. According to Dr J V R Prasad Rao, project director of National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), the project is the first of its kind in India and will be introduced in other states later.,""Though we encourage services of a permanent nature, we were prompted by the unique composition of Mumbai's population, its high number of migrants and the inaccessibleareas. This city has the highest number of HIV infected in the country -- almost two per cent of its adult population and it's necessary to reach out them to prevent the spread of AIDS,'' he said.,Dr Rao informed that a national hotline number (1097) for counselling on AIDS will be available in Mumbai within a month. The number can also be used for leaving behind questions to be answered later and also receive complaints about non-availability or refusal of treatment in hospitals. The Ministry of Environment and Forests has outlined procedures for disposal of medical waste which will come into force from October '99 onwards. Any hospital found flouting these rules can be asked to shut down by the government, he said, adding that hospitals around the country have been asked to get strict with infection control procedures.,The mobile clinics plan to screen blood for HIV and syphilis, provide counselling services for adoption of safe sex practices and promotion of sexual behaviour changes. It will alsoencourage social mobilisation of the community by involving trade unions, rickshaws and taxi unions and other hard-to-reach population groups.,The first visits are planned for the Dahisar check-naka from where almost 2,500 trucks arrive in the city daily. Says Dr Dilip Vaswani, deputy director (STI), MDACS, ""Considering that every truck has a driver and one cleaner, that would translate to roughly 5,000 people at one check-naka alone''. The clinic will visit the Mulund check-nakas at Eastern Express highway and LBS Marg and the Mumbai-Panvel Highway check-naka. Hanuman Nagar at Ghatkopar (W) and Sonapur at Bhandup, which have a high population of CSWs and eunuchs, are also on the list.,The MDACS has also planned to bring out Information, Education and Communication (IEC) vans displaying charts informing people about sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS. The van will visit colleges and other areas and will have a screen outside to show educational films on related subjects.

Since the court was unable to hear it immediately, the division bench gave the petitioners liberty to move the court again after three weeks for a date for a final hearing.,The petition has been supported by the Central government through an affidavit which, while pointing out that the Supreme Court judgement in the case of Mr X v/s Hospital Z has to be considered, has held that the right to marry for an HIV positive person is ""protected, provided the prospective spouse is informed about the HIV status of the person''.,An affidavit filed by the joint director (technical), government of India, Ministry of health and Family Welfare, National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), says a prospective spouse should be informed about the HIV status of the person, and only after the spouse gives a ""full, free and informed consent to the marriage, understanding the implications of un-protected sex with the infected partner and in relation to his/her health on becoming pregnant and thereby transmitting the infection to the new born,'' is the right to marry of an HIV positive person is protected.,As reported by Express Newsline earlier, the entire petition arose from the SC judgement in 1988 which held that while patients suffering from HIV ""deserve full sympathy and are entitled to all respect as human beings..but sex with them or the possiblity thereof has to be avoided as otherwise they would infect and communicate the dreadful disease to others''.,At the courtroom, Justice Srikrishna argued that it would not be possible to review an SC judgement in the high court, to which advocate Anand Grover of the Collective persuaded the bench that the petition did not challenge the SC judgement at all. ""The petitioners (one man and a woman, both HIV +ive,) are apprehensive that even if they want to marry with the full, free and informed consent of their spouses, somebody may report the marraige and the police, working on the SC judgement, might subject them to criminal action'', argued Grover.,Grover argued that discordant HIV couples (where one of the partners does not have HIV) can have protected sex and also children through artificial insemination. He argued that there are many such couples who have had children without transmitting HIV to them. He also argued that if HIV is considered to be a communicable venereal disease, it cannot be a ground for preventing the marraige, if consent to the marraige is based on disclosure of the HIV status. However, it could be a ground for divorce in a post marital situation. Conversely, if the consent to the marraige is obtained without the disclosure of the status, it marraige could be declared void.,State government pleader, R V Govilkar on his part, stated that the court cannot overlook the rights of the unborn - the result of the marriage of such couples. He also pointed out that one cannot overlook the fact of an impending death of the HIV positive persons. To this, additional solicitor general, D Y Chandrachud said death was a fact for everybody, not just for the HIV positive.

But the reunion was tinged with sadness when the 25-year-old mother, a resident of Vile Parle, was told her baby had the Human Immuno-Deficiency Virus.,The three-day-old boy was sleeping on a cot in his kidnapper's house at Santacruz when police found him and took Farzana Chavivala (40) and her husband into custody, two days after an intensive house-to-house by the Oshiwara police concluded. Farzana, who has admitted to lifting the child from the nursing home on Saturday, explained that she was desperate to have a baby ever since her childless marriage several years ago. Her overwhelming maternal instincts have, however, placed her in custody after she was charged under Section 363 of the Indian Penal Code.,Sub-Inspector Arun More of the Oshiwara police told Express Newsline that Farzana had kidnapped the child from the nursing home in Jogeshwari just afterRashida's friends and relatives had left after visiting hours. Farzana, who had earlier mingled with the visitors, returned and began to chat up Rashida. The latter, a first-time mother, then entrusted her baby to Farzana while she went to the bathroom. When she emerged, both the baby and the middle-aged stranger were gone.,After a case of kidnapping was lodged, police visited several hospitals and nursing homes in pairs, till sub-inspectors More and Zebeida Sheikh arrived at Surya Nursing Home at Santacruz. After showing a sketch of the suspect to the nurses on duty, police realised that Farzana had brought the infant there for a check-up. The doctors had told Farzana that the boy was HIV positive but since the nursing home lacked the facilities to treat HIV patients, the woman took the baby home.,Armed with Farzana's address, police went to her residence at Golibar, Santacruz (E) today, and found the baby had his kidnapper there. When Farzana could not explain the child's presence, police realised theyhad hit pay dirt.,Farzana later told the police that she was so desperate to have a child that she had been visiting nursing homes and hospitals in the western suburbs since several months. When she saw Rashida's child, she could not resist the temptation. She said she decided to `keep' the baby even after he was diagnosed as being HIV positive.,Dr Hemangi Dhavale, head of the Department of Psychiatry, Nair Hospital, told Express Newsline that it is not unusual for childless women to kidnap infants. Under intense pressure from their husbands and in-laws, some of them even resort to kidnapping, she said. Some women are even threatened with divorce, Dr Dhavale adds.,In fact, a baby had been snatched from a Ghatkopar nursing home in mid-1998 by a woman who had said her childless marriage had similarly pushed her to the brink of desperation.

"Posted:, Mon Aug 02 1999 IST",To tell or not -- HIV debate brews,"    NEW DELHI, August 1: The debate about the right to privacy of an HIV positive person is brewing once again. This follows the Delhi AIDS Control Society's (DACS) recent letter to the Indian Medical Association about the norms for sexual/marital notification in cases of HIV/AIDS.,The Delhi AIDS Control Society and National AIDS Control Organisation argue that patient's status should be revealed to his/her partner with or without the patient's consent. Social organisations working among AIDS patients believe it is unethical and will prompt more and more HIV positive people to go ""into hiding.'',The DACS letter suggests the Supreme Court judgment on the issue be circulated among all clinicians with a view to facilitate a ""decision'' conforming to the Supreme Court judgment. The Supreme Court ruling in September 1998 on a petition filed by an AIDS patient said that his doctor was justified in telling his fiancee that he was HIV positive. (see box)Says Dr. Ashok Kumar of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS): ""Whether you should seek the consent of a patient while informing the spouse varies from patient to patient. So far there was no policy regarding this and it was left to the doctor's discretion.'' The NGOs fear that this situation may change after the DACS letter.,C.S. Khariwal, Director, DACS says the ruling was being circulated to keep the doctors informed. ""The national policy was for informing relatives with the patient's consent. But for telling a partner, the ruling does not insist on consent,'' he adds.,While some lawyers described the Delhi AIDS Control Society letter as unconstitutional, NGOs working in the field are threatening to move court against it. Many are consoling themselves over the fact that the DACS has not asked the doctors to follow the Supreme Court judgment, it has only asked them to refer to it while handling such situations.,According to AIDS activist Anjali Gopalan, the Government is moving against its own efforts to ensure confidentiality to HIV patients by giving doctors the green signal to reveal their medical status to their partners. Says Gopalan who runs the NGO Naz Foundation: ""Once there is no confidentiality, patients will go into hiding rather than risk betrayal by doctors,'' she says.,Some legal experts agree. ""The letter asking for circulation of the court ruling among doctors sets doctors at liberty to inform the patient's sexual partners. But nowhere does it say that the patient should be informed about this or his consent taken,'' says Aurobindo Ghosh, a lawyer. He said that the ruling, if made universally applicable, will also mean violation of Article 14 which guarantees the fundamental right to equality. If in all other medical cases, confidentiality and consent of patient are the law, then the HIV patient cannot be denied this right, he said.,George Pulikan, another lawyer, says that any Supreme Court ruling should be treated as law. ""But it is appropriate in only situations that are identical to the case that prompted the ruling,'' he adds.,The DACS initiative has the full support of NACO. In fact, its letter to IMA says it is accompanied by a copy of a letter from the NACO chief J.V.R. Prasada Rao. Rao told Express Newsline that that it was part of the national AIDS policy to reveal the patient's status to the partner even without the patient's consent. For partner notification, consent is not necessary, he said.,As for the DACS letter, he said NACO had been calling for partner notification after the Supreme Court ruling. Dr Chinkolal Thansing, who has been working for AIDS patients here, says that doctors should inform a patient's partner or any relative only with his or her consent or counsel him and make him inform the spouse. He adds that already many doctors were abruptly informing relatives without proper counseling and scaring off the patient.

"Posted:, Sun Aug 15 1999 IST","India disregards study, rejects new HIV drug","    NEW DELHI, Aug 14: The National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) here is planning to use the drug, AZT, on pregnant women to keep the infection from spreading to the newborn. This comes despite a study by Ugandan scientists saying a new drug Nevirapine is more effective in cutting down transfer of HIV from pregnant mothers to the newborns.,NACO's joint director P L Joshi said though the organisation was aware of the findings of the Ugandan study that Nevirapine commonly given to AIDS patients was more effective than AZT in preventing transmission of infection from the mother to child, NACO would use a known drug like AZT rather than experiment with a new one. Dispelling fears about the toxicity of AZT and the long course of treatment, he also said that Nevirapine was not available in the market.,Dr Chinkolal Thansing, who has been treating HIV AIDS patients in Delhi, confirmed that Nevirapine was available only in the black market and that too in bulk, making it unaffordable. He disclosed that AZT wasbeing given to pregnant HIV patients in a clinic run by an NGO here.,Ugandan scientists in Kampala tested the new drug on 310 pregnant women and administered AZT to 308 women. While 59 infants born to mothers who were given AZT were found infected, only 35 infants born to mothers who took Nevirapine had got the virus. It showed that AZT cuts the risk of infection to 25 per cent while the new drug cuts it down to 13 per cent.,Reporting on the research last month, The New York Times said apart from its effectiveness, the new drug had many added advantages. Only one dose was required to be given to the mother and one to the child. It said while the mother must take it during the labour period, the baby should be fed the drug once in syrup form within three days of being born. In comparison, according to The Times, AZT is taken five times a day from the 14th week of pregnancy and fed to the infant four times a day for six weeks. As for the cost, the AZT regimen costs around Rs 14,000 and has more doseswhile Nevirapine doses would cost Rs 200.,The drug has been marketed in the US since 1996 as a combination to be taken in a cocktail of three anti-virus drugs for AIDS patients.,""In India, the drug is available only in bulk and is of no use unless it is for a big ante-natal clinic with many needy patients,'' Thansingh said.The Ugandan researchers will monitor the infants for 18 months to determine any adverse effects, The Times says. ""The low cost makes it feasible for wide scale use in many developing countries,'' said Dr Anthony S Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, in an interview to The Times.,Dr Peter Piot, head of the UN AIDS programme in Geneva, is quoted as saying that the Nevirapine study is a ""major gain'' because it approaches ideal prevention therapy for developing countries where 95 per cent of the HIV-infected people live. However, Joshi said it was more important to identify the patients rather than find a drug for them, adding, however,that screening involved ethical issues. The UN AIDS group estimates that every day 1,800 HIV-infected babies are born in developing countries where most women do not receive pre-natal care. In some areas of Africa, up to 40 per cent of pregnant women are HIV-infected and 25 to 35 per cent of their children would be born infected if no therapy is provided.,AZT and other anti-HIV drugs have drastically reduced mother-to-child transmission in the US since 1994 when a Federally-sponsored study showed that AZT taken for several weeks could stop it. However, in third world countries, the long AZT regimen is seen as impractical.

"Posted:, Fri Oct 01 1999 IST",JJ to test anti-HIV medicine,"    MUMBAI, SEPT 30: The ethical committee of J J Hospital today approved of a drug trail in which an anti HIV medicine will be studied for its effect on reducing chances of HIV positive pregnant women passing on the infection to their newborns.,According to hospital dean, Dr AC Mohanty, this project has been proposed by the National AIDS Control Organisation and will be funded by the United Nations International Childrens Educational Fund. It is proposed to carry out such trails at 11 centres throughout the country, and JJ Hospital will be one of these centres, he said. Other centres includes hospitals at Pune, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Manipur, he added.,Sources said that HIV virus getting transmitted from HIV positive pregnant woman to her newborn is one of three modes of transmission of this disease. And the percentage of this transmission is believed to be between 30 to 40 percent. It is further believed that children born through the vaginal route have a higher chance of getting the HIV infection thatthose born through the Caeserian route, sources said.,Therefore, this drug, known as Zidovudine, will be given to such women during their pregnancy so that the chances of the infection getting passed on to their newborns gets reduced. Sources said that this drug has already been in the market for the last seven to eight years, and has been found to be be effective in reducing the chances of such women passing on the infection to their newborns. Studies in some western countries have shown this percentage of passing on the infection to the newborns can be reduced to as low as seven to nine percent, sources said.,Explaining the idean behind the project, Dr Mohanty said that after the trails are completed at all the centres, the NACO will compile the data and study the results. If the drug is found to be effective in reducing the chances of mother-child transmission, then this drug will be introduced in the Maternal and Child Health Program of the respective states, he pointed out.,According to Dr Mohanty,this medicine will be given to only those women who are willing to take part in the trail. The drug will be given to such women during the last three months of their pregnancy and during the labour period through the intra venous method. It is also important that the mothers should not breast feed the child after delivery because breast feeding can also pass on the HIV infection, he said. He said that the duration of the project will be around 18 months and it will start after NACO makes all the arrangements of providing the staff and the equipment that is needed for it.,A senior doctor at the hospital revealed that ethical committee could not arrive at a decision on two previous occassions because of lack of literature about the project. However, this was provided to them recently and the approval was given today by 16 member committee to carry out the project today.

"Posted:, Mon Nov 15 1999 IST",High court to hear plea on right of HIV-infected to marry,"    NOVEMBER 14: Recent statistics put the number of HIV positive cases in India at 3.5 million. Of these, Maharashtra tops the list. The disease is displaying a paradigm shift in movement from urban to rural areas, from high risk to general population, through migrant labourers from the cities, to the waiting wives in the villages. One in every four HIV positive cases are women...,In the light of these facts, should HIV victims be given an untrammelled right to marry even with full disclosure to their respective spouses? If no, where does one draw the line and how should the restrictions be legislated? The Bombay High Court bench of Justice M B Ghodeswar and Justice S Radhakrishnan is expected to deliver a crucial judgement on these issues next week when the court reopens, on a petition filed by the Lawyers Collective on behalf of two HIV positive patients called A and C.,The petitioners' plea: Given that the Supreme Court had in a case `Mr X v Hospital Z' held that marriage for HIV patients was a suspendedright, they wanted a `clarification' from the high court that ""provided there was full disclosure and informed consent'' HIV patients could marry.,But the arguments, in many ways, ended up as ""HIV positive men v/s the right of women to public health'', where additional solicitor general D Y Chandrachud and women's rights activist Flavia Agnes opposed the submissions of the petitioners, represented by Anand Grover and C U Singh.,Chandrachud argued before the bench that there were very few facts before them for consideration. ""The law should not be benefitted by people who were liable to misuse it,'' he said adding that the socio-economic disabilities of women, where poverty and illiteracy exists, made them as a class, extremely vulnerable to exploitation. ""It would not be adequate to just tell the prospective spouse that I am HIV positive and leave it at that.'',Drawing on the limitations of consent where section 375 of the IPC lays down that sexual intercourse by a man with his wife does notconstitute rape, no `consent' other than that to marriage is contemplated under the section, Chandrachud pointed out. He admitted though that the mere act of solemnisation of a marriage is not an offence under section 269/270 (spreading of infectious diseases) of the IPC, but one could not ask for a carte blanche non applicability of that section. ""What the petitioners want is that the police not take any action under this section'', argued state government pleader R V Govilkar, as well.,Agnes on her part pointed out to the harsh realities of society. That women were inequal partners in marriages. That much as the petitioners made out a case for condoms, these had failed even as a family planning measure because they were of poor quality and were an instrument of male prerogative. She argued that the desire for an HIV positive man to marry was purely for selfish purposes; to have a wife cook for him, wash his clothes and give him children. ""The situation of afflicted women is stark and poignant. Therehave been cases where such women are driven to suicide, as there is noone to look after them,'' she argued.,The petitioners reached out to a future of possibilities what with striding medical research, and reiterated that a regular life with marriage, safe sex and even children was a possibility for HIV victims. Reading from the latest issue of the medical journal Lancet, Singh argued that a new drug had been invented that could be given to an infected expecting mother and her new born child to prevent the child from being infected. Multi drug therapies had also increased the lifespan of HIV victims.,Pointing out that one needed social measures as well, Singh used the example of Thailand, that distributes condoms to control the spread of AIDS. He remarked that there was more awareness among Indians, and even though the social distribution of condoms had decreased, market sales had increased. ""To prohibit an HIV victim from marrying on threat of criminal action would only drive the disease underground,''the petitioners argued.,HIV's spreading footprint over women, kidsIn 1993, the Nowrosjee Wadia Maternity hospital started testing all its patients for HIV. Till December 1998 they had tested over 72,000 women, all low risk housewives. Statistics that started out by showing a 0.7 per cent prevalence of HIV in these patients in 1993 have today shot up to two per cent. Of the 25 million odd babies being born in India every year, one third are likely to be infected.,`An Update on HIV Infection in Women and Children', organised by the B J Wadia Hospital for children this morning, gave doctors, social workers and experts a chance to discuss these growing numbers. In his opening remarks, Dr Rashid Merchant, Dean and professor of pediatrics at the hospital explained: ""The health profile of children is drastically being affected. In the late '80s and early '90s, we noticed that an increasing number of children were showing clinical symptoms of AIDS. The number of cases where the mother has transmittedthe virus to the child is growing. Our hospital has developed a model which helps prevent the vertical transmission of the virus from the mother to the child. More work needs to be done.'',Added Dr Jyotsana Karkare of the hospital, ""Most patients are first time mothers and all of them housewives. In 91 per cent of the cases, they have contracted HIV through their husbands. Two per cent get the virus from blood transfusions and seven per cent from unexplained factors.'',Chad Womack from the National Institute of Health, USA said: ""This virus has shown an amazing capacity to divide into subtypes. The C subtype virus is the most prevalent in South Africa and India. Last year's statistics indicate that 12 to 15 million people have already been infected and the number is increasing. Around 50 per cent of the world population infected by HIV is women.'',The risk of transmission from a pregnant mother to her baby is reported to be between 21 and 43 per cent in developing countries. Experts add that there isan additional 14 to 17 per cent risk of the virus being transmitted with breast feeding.,The importance of counselling in the Indian social context was also discussed. The two performances by the nursing students from the hospital highlighted the importance of educating the people about HIV and AIDS.Chief guest Sunil Dutt, on his part, promised to get the government moving on the issue. Surprised that hospitals involved in AIDS work were not getting any aid, he said that he would take up the issue in Parliament.

"Posted:, Thu Nov 11 1999 IST",It's official -- India has 3.5 m HIV cases,"    NEW DELHI, NOV 10: A couple of months ago when UN Secretary General Kofi Annan told the UN General Assembly that India had 8.5 million HIV/AIDS cases, he set alarm bells ringing.,Not just in India, but across the globe. Epidemiologists and public health agencies who have been keeping track of the spread of the fatal disease which attacks the immune system and results in death, were clearly disturbed by the figure.,From figures ranging from one percent of the population, which would mean 10 million cases, guesstimates ranged from five, six, seven or eight million. Each time the number would be different, resulting in a rather hazy picture of the HIV scenario in India.,Now the National Aids Control Organisation, better known by its acronym NACO, the Union Health Ministry's high-profile division handling all matters relating to HIV/AIDS in India, has decided to put an end to all the speculation.,Armed with statistical backing, the NACO on Tuesday came out with a definitive figure, putting the number of HIV cases in the country at 3.5 million. ""This will set at rest the kind of wild guesses and speculation which had resulted in a highly distorted picture of AIDS in India,"" NACO chief J V R Prasada Rao said. However, he cautions that this too is a ""working estimate"" of the total number of people living with HIV and AIDS in India. Apart from the all-India figure, NACO also has the breakup of HIV/AIDS cases among male and female population, the rural-urban divide and state-wise figures for every state and Union Territory in the country.,Maharashtra heads the list of states with the highest numbers of HIV sufferers, whether male, female, urban or rural, followed closely by Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Manipur and Goa. Explaining this regional concentration of HIV cases, Rao said that it was due to the high migration from these states to urban metropolitan centres like Mumbai. ,Intensive research on the spreading tentacles of the disease showed the migration of sex workers, truckers and migrant labour from the southern states to Maharashtra.,In Manipur, the high incidence of the disease was due to the large presence of intra-venous drug users.,West Bengal and Gujurat have been categorised as ""moderate"" and the rest of the country figures in the low prevalence category.,Policy planners and health experts say that the statewise figures would prove invaluable in planning programmes to not just arrest the trend (of spread of the disease), but also in chalking out care and support systems. Statewise estimates would also sensitise state administrations to identify problem areas and gear the administration for effective appropriate measures, said Rao.,India's efforts at curbing the spread of HIV/AIDS also came in for close scrutiny at last month's Monitoring AIDS Pandemic (MAP) meeting in Kuala Lumpur. The problem was also examined from a sub-continental perspective since a major cause of the spread of HIV/AIDS was due to the trafficking of girls and children, primarily from Nepal and Bangladesh to urban centres like Mumbai and Calcutta, where they are pushed into prostitution. At the Kuala Lumpur meet, the regional countries adopted a Regional Plan of Action to tackle HIV/AIDS and its causes. A regional meeting of representatives from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bhutan is on the anvil, where they will share expertise on AIDS prevention and control and examine government-to-government efforts to end the growing traffic in women children.

That was in April 1997, a few days after her husband, Ranbeer Singh, had died. ,Doctors at the medical college said Ranbeer Singh had tested HIV positive after an Elisa test. Now over two years later, on November 11, 27-year-old Kaushalya has tested HIV negative. The confirmatory Western Blot test conducted at a private laboratory by Joint Action Council Kannur - a non-governmental organisation here - which showed her to be HIV negative, has raised doubts about the correctness of the results of the test conducted on her dead husband by the Rohtak Medical College. Both Ranbeer Singh and Kaushalya were subjected only to the preliminary Elisa test and pronounced HIV positive.,Dr D R Arora, head of department of microbiology at Rohtak Medical College, said such a variation in results ispossible. Asked why he had then advised abortion after the Elisa test, he said he could not comment.,He, however, said that he had advised the woman to terminate the pregnancy as there was a 22 to 40 per cent chance of a newborn being infected. He said that the woman had not been forced to have an abortion, and if she had gone ahead with it, it was probably because she wanted to marry her brother-in-law Rohtas Singh.,He said that the department had conducted both an Elisa test and a Capillus test and she had tested positive. As is the practice among the medical college doctors, Doctor Arora said, he had advised Kaushalya that she should not disclose her condition to her family or she would be thrown out.Meanwhile, local newspapers carried a report on Kaushalya's HIV status as a result of which the whole village began ostracising her as well as the family.,""They did not interact with us for at least six months. They did not let their children play with our children,"" recalls Parem, Kaushalya'smother-in-law. ""They did not let me draw water from the village well for many months,"" said Kaushalya. ""We had to make do with the hard water available here."",Both Kaushalya's present husband Rohtas and his brothers, Sahib Singh and Shamphul, were rejected by the families where they were to be married into after the news of their brother's death was splashed in the newspapers.Her in-laws, however, had complete faith that the couple were not HIV positive. ""We knew all along that she did not have any disease,"" says Mangeram, her father-in-law and a well-to-do farmer in Chochi. They, in fact, went to the extent of getting Kaushalya married to their second son Rohtas a year after Ranbeer died, in keeping with the Jat tradition.The re-test has come as a victory for the family and a justification of their faith in their deceased son and his wife.,Today, Kaushalya has a three-month-old baby, besides the three daughters from her first marriage.,""Tujhe aur tere bacche ko parmatma bhi nahi bacha sakega (Even Godcan't save you and your child) was what doctors told Kaushalya,"" Mangeram recalls. ""But we knew that neither our son nor our daughter-in-law had AIDS.""Chochi villagers are yet to fully accept Kaushalya as being healthy and safe. They are non-committal and guarded in their responses. ""The doctors know best,"" that is what Kaushalya's neighbour Nathiya says when told that Kaushalya had tested negative.,""She is so healthy. Maybe the newspapers had made it all up,"" says a village school master, Ram Bhaj Joon. ""Or the doctors went wrong.""

""Till date there is no scientific evidence of the existence of the virus, all claims to the contrary notwithstanding,'' he said.,""The HIV hypothesis is the biggest scandal in the history of the world. The HIV theory was a big scientific mistake that has created havoc among societies all over the world. US, the originator of theclumsy theory, is now too embarrassed to accept that fallacy and tell the world the vital truth that there is no virus causing AIDS,'' said Giraldo.,Of course the HIV hypothesis was readily grabbed by the multinational pharmaceutical companies who saw in it a lifetime opportunity to sell their drugs and HIV positive testing kits. The condom manufacturers too jumped on the bandwagon to mint money.,AIDS is not caused by any virus, but is a result of malnutrition, host of chemical toxins, recreational drugs like cocaine, marijuana, physical and biological reasons and psychological factors, said Giraldo. AIDS afflicted people must never take AZT and similar medicines. Positive living, correct medication and proper diet can help a person overcome the ailment, he said.,Talking to the media Dr E D Harven from France who has been working on isolation of virus for the last 35 years said what people think about HIV is not real at all. But it is sad that no one has seriously asked questions about the HIVhypothesis.,While all existing virus in the world can be seen by a microscope, HIV has never been seen. No one has been able to give scientific data about the existence of the virus. The HIV tests are highly inaccurate and misleading and have only resulted in confusing the people. The methodology of diagnosing AIDS through HIV positive hypothesis is wrong. AIDS research has therefore gone completely off track and billions of dollars are being spent on finding the virus that does not exist.,Dr Klaus Kohlein from Germany said in the name of saving the lives of AIDS patients medicines like AZT and others are given which in fact are highly toxic. AZT is the same medicine that had been found to be highly dangerous after it was tested on cancer patients. By killing the growing cells in human beings, the drug ultimately kills the patient.,HIV is neither infectious, nor can be sexually transmitted, claimed Kohlein. The idea of it being sexually transmitted originated because of the first cases of AIDSdiscovered in the world were from gay people in the US who were highly promiscuous, he said.,Casting doubt on the existence of HIV, Kohlein said unlike other existing viruses, it can neither be cultured, nor can it be grown in the laboratory. No wonder HIV has never been isolated at all, he said. He also cast doubts on the HIV tests which are not specific and the manufacturing companies state that these tests cannot be used to diagnose AIDS!,Giraldo said he with like-minded people had formed a group to create awareness about HIV and AIDS. The media has not been very helpful so far, but things are changing slowly. The group is also trying to take help of artists in various countries to spread their message.

Everyone in the place I work knew that I was HIV-positive except me and the institution asked me for my resignation. I was crushed, but I stayed with my husband till his death."",""After his death, my people took me home. Initially, the neighbours avoided us, afraid I will infect them by my mere proximity. But now they have become aware that HIV is just another infection and have become friendly. I was in total despair until I came for counselling at Ashraya and became a member of CPK-Plus. Interacting with them has erased my phobia. I am searching for work now,"" Nisha says., ""There is absolute need for sensitising the people,"" according to Dr Rama Menon, the mainstay of Ashraya and the backbone of CPK-Plus., There are 45 of them, including seven women, coming from across the length and breadth of Kerala, united in their affliction, determined to LIVE life. ""No, we do not seek sex now. The infection has muted our sex urges,"" confesses Joshi, who is HIV-positive., Currently, all that mars their joy and optimism is the periodical infections they contract because of their weakened immune system. Shibu is the only one among them who is silent and downcast., Says Dr Rama: ""He was suffering from a fungal infection and that has demoralised him. They are vulnerable to TB infection, but the government's TB programme is very strong. They get free and effective treatment. The treatment for systemic fungal infection is very expensive and patients have to buy the medicines themselves. The government should provide them with the medicines for this disease as well."", There are other emotional problems they encounter. Abu's wife deserted him after she came to know of his HIV status. He is unfazed, but for the fact that he is not permitted to see his child. ""Both my wife and child are negative,"" Abu says with visible relief, adding: ""I wish she would let me see my child."", There are couples also in CPK-Plus, as normal and happy as any other, with the wife nursing no bitterness about the infection given to her by the husband. Says Ramani: ""My husband was found to be HIV-positive when his blood was tested for a cataract operation. The families rejected us outright. They asked us to go into some forest and die. They looked at us as if we were some creatures from another planet. We left our place and live in anonymity now. My husband has found work. He has no symptoms, but I continue to experience mild infections on and off."", Any hope for the HIV-hit?, ""They can live a quality life until some opportunistic infection kills them. Some of them need medication like the anti-retro-viral tablets, which is imported and very expensive. They need governmental support,"" stresses Dr Rama., ""What is necessary is community sensitisation and peer interaction. We have registered a post box so that other HIV-positive people can get in touch with us, but we have no funds to publicise it,"" says the CPK-Plus president., Their post box number is 2002, Kadavanthara, Kochi - 682 020. They have also brought out a sticker, asking the HIV-hit in the State to get in touch with them. The CPK-Plus meets once in three months.,

"Posted:, Sun Apr 09 2000 IST",Children follow truckers on the HIV route," , VIJAYAWADA, APRIL 8: After lorry drivers and cleaners, it is the turn of street children to fall victim to the dreaded HIV infection in the coastal regions of Andhra Pradesh. Several teenagers are turning into gigolos risking their health for a few bucks, thanks to their ignorance and the absence of proper mechanism to check sexual abuse.,V Surya of Tenali is one such boy. He ran away from home five years ago when his parents insisted on his taking up farm work. Reaching the city, he joined the band of rag-pickers., Learning about a home for street children through his seniors, he joined the institution. Ever since, his daily routine, like that of many other inmates, has been to collect and dispose off rags, clean railway compartments, serve food at wedding parties or similar functions during the day and return home for rest at night. Surya has been hired as a `sex worker' on several occasions.,Noted sexologist Dr G Samaram says so far he has tested 300 street children aged between 13 and 18. Nearly 200 of them are suffering from Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs). ""On suspicion, I screened blood samples of 30 youths for HIV. Of them, 6 were found to be positive,"" he disclosed., According to Surya, he was wandering at a local railway station recently when two middle-aged women approached him. ""They offered Rs 200 if I had sex with one of them. When I agreed to do so, they bought a ticket for me too and the three of us boarded a train. Standing guard for us, one of themsent me and her companion into a vacant ladies coupe. After I satisfied her, they dropped me at a station from where I took another train to reach the city,"" he narrated., Next time, he was hired by two young women. Aged about 20 and inmates of a hostel, the women approached Surya at the local bus station. ""They took me to a lodge near Besant Road. Though they were not good looking, I agreed to satisfy their lust as they promised to pay Rs 300, which was quite a big amount for me. I spent the whole night with them, took the money and pushed off after daybreak,"" he added., Same is the case with Ramana and Srinu, who are in their late teens. Kareem Hotel Centre, Diamond Hotel Centre and Eluru Locks, the bus station and the railway station serve as centres of such activity for many a youth., Lately, a healthy Ramana has begun losing weight after his 'affairs' with some college girls. ""Frequently, I get cough and muscular pains. Sometimes, it is difficult even to get up from bed."", Samaram points out that the situation is grave. ""Besides lorry drivers and cleaners, street children are becoming the most vulnerable to HIV infection. The government should immediately step in to check sexual abuse of street children,"" the doctor pleaded.,

"Posted:, Sun Jun 04 2000 IST",Contradictory reports on no of HIV patients," , NEW DELHI, JUNE 3: Unitl last month, there were 35,000 HIV-positive cases in the Capital -- a figure which the government has been quoting for the last two years. But last week, Health Minister A.K. Walia said that Delhi has only 15,000 HIV-positive cases. And as per the latest official statistics available, not a single person has died of AIDS in Delhi in the last two years. So where have these 20,000 HIV-positive persons disappeared?,Director of the Delhi AIDS Control Society, G.S. Khairwal says that these persons are very much around. The problem, he says, lies with the estimates made. ""The figures are not reliable as they are based on blood samples of some people and not of the entire population,'' says Khairwal.,The 35,000 figure was based on a surveillance conducted in Delhi in 1998, says Khairwal. ""And the surveillance conducted in 1999 gave us the 15,000 figure,'' he says.,The two varying figures, Khairwal says, do not indicate any drastic change in the HIV scene. ""These are all estimates based on a limited number of blood samples,'' he explains.,""If the blood samples happen to have specimens of more HIV-positive persons, then we get a big figure. And the figure is low, if, in a given set of samples, few persons happen to be HIV-positive,'' says Khairwal.,The surveillance is done every month at seven centres in Delhi based on blood samples collected from groups marked by the government as `high risk'. According to the government, prostitutes, slum-dwellers and truck drivers fall in these `high risk' groups.,Human rights activist Purushottaman Mulloli, however, argues: ""There is no explanation for the fall in numbers.'' He explains ""this is so because the figures are cumulative. The figure of each month is added to the previous total.'',""The truth is that these figures are fictitious,'' he adds. ""The bureaucrats give a lower figure because they do not remember the previous data and think the public is too ignorant to recall it and raise questions, says Mulloli.,Which means that in case of no deaths being reported, the number could certainly not have fallen.,Meanwhile, Mulloli has shot off a letter to Health Minister A.K.Walia saying that his contradictory statements to the press ""can only create alarm and confusion among the general public and only serve to make sections of people vulnerable to the drugs and prejudices being promoted through your campaign.'',""Your action is scientifically unvalidated, medically irrational, socially damaging and abusive of public funds,'' Mulloli, who represents an NGO Joint Action Council Kannur, said.,Khairwal, however, maintains that in any case, the fact that fresh estimates have recorded a lower number of HIV-positive cases should be welcomed.

"Posted:, Wed Jun 28 2000 IST","Mystery of HIV ""reservoirs"" in the body deepens"," , PARIS, JUNE 27: A problem that has dogged the search for a cure for AIDS has turned out to be more complex than originally thought, prompting some researchers to believe they may have to return to the drawing board.,A few years ago, the success of a triple ""cocktail"" of anti-retroviral drugs led some scientists to hope they could wipe out the human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV), the cause of AIDS. But dismaying evidence to the contrary emerged last year, with the discovery that the drugs suppress the virus but do not eliminate it.,The conclusion was that a relatively small number of infected cells hole up in hidden ""reservoirs"" in the body, only to re-emerge and multiply as soon as the drugs are stopped. One of the suspected latent reservoirs is the body's lymph glands.,Researchers at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), writing in July's issue of the journal Nature, say they now believe that the virus has additional other ways of hiding.,They carried out tests on nine patients who had been receiving the cocktail, called highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), and whose level of HIV infection in the blood had slipped below detectable levels for an average of 21.8 months. HAART was discontinued, and HIV levels in the bloodstream quickly rose again -- but in four of the nine cases, the virus was genetically different from the one initially treated.,""These results indicate the existence of other persistent HIV reservoirs that could prompt rapid emergence of plasma viremia after cessation of HAART,"" the NIH researchers write.,In an adjoining commentary, leading researchers David Ho and Zhang Linqi of the Aaaron Diamond AIDS Research Center at New York's Rockefeller University said the findings highlight the prevailing ignorance about how the latent reservoirs work. ""In tackling the issue of HIV-1 eradication, we should not be content with 'pounding away' at the virus using only existing anti-retroviral drugs. Instead, we must undertake studies to unravel the fundamental mechanism responsible for the residual viral replication,"" they write.,HAART has several drawbacks, including side-effects and cost. Annual treatment is around 2,900 dollars per person per year, putting it way beyond the reach of HIV victims in Africa, by far the most affected region for AIDS.,Meanwhile, Swiss scientists called for clinical trials of a drug, mycophenolic acid, saying it had the potential to boost the effectiveness of HAART. The drug is already used in conjunction with other treatments to prevent organ rejection after transplants.,In a Pilot clinical study, also published in Nature Medicine, the team from the University Hospital in Vadois found that mycophenolic acid, when used with HAART, reduced the amount of infection as well as the numbers of two types of blood cells that are hijacked by the virus and used as a vehicle for replication.

But these are not dependable,'' he said. He also said that often the States fail to update figures or there is lack of interaction between the centre and states leading to false projections of HIV cases.,NACO annual report from next year will depend entirely on figures provided by sample surveys done at sentinel surveillance centres across the country. There are 180 centres at present to which 55 new ones are being added, he said. Each centre would pick up 400 blood samples each year and out of these the number of HIV positives would reflect on the per centage of HIV positive cases in that area, he said.,Asked how this would ensure accuracy, he said that it would be done every year and that would give a better idea than taking up visible cases only.,NACO has been criticised recently by a non governmental organsation Joint Action Council Kannur based in Delhi for its inaccurate data on HIV and AIDS cases. JACK convenor Purushottaman Mulloli has pointed out inaccuracies especially in NACO's figures for Kerala and Manipur. The latter considered to be having the largest number of AIDS cases according to Mulloli has been showing a decrease in the number of cases screened while showing an increase in the number of HIV cases. As new cases are added on to the existing numbers screened making an increase inevitable, the decrease had roused suspicions.,Rao said that JACK had pointed out inaccuracies in data especially in Manipur and Kerala. ""However, improvement in data collection has been on the cards for some time. Besides we have been giving data based on sentinel surveillance figures to Parliament too,'' Rao said. ""The national figure based on reported cases is only 90,000. But we are going by sentinel surveillance figures which give us 3.5 million HIV cases in the country,'' Rao said.,Mulloli who has brought these allegations of inaccuracy against NACO said that Rao should be tried and punished for misleading the public and the Parliament for the last six years. This proves that NACO is a national security threat as it has been whipping up a fear psychosis and defrauding the public and misusing public money by projecting exaggerated figures., The inaccuracies are evident in data published in naco's country reports for 1996, 1998 and 1999, which shows that some statistics have remained unchanged in a few states. NACO reports show that cumulative number of persons screened in Kerala was 43,927 in 1997 and remained static at 44,547 from 1998-2000. The number of HIV-positive cases in Kerala has remained unchanged at 215 ever since 1996, upto May this year, while the number of AIDS cases has been same --102-- over all these years., However data sent by the State AIDS surveillance centres for 1996 show that 36,304 persons were screened, of whom 795 were found to be HIV-positive and 190 were full-blown AIDS cases far more than the NACO data., The data for Manipur shows an decrease in cumulative number of persons screened, from 40,557 upto 1996 to 29,975 upto 1998. But the number of HIV-positives shot up from 3,712 in 1996 to 5,327 in 1998!,Rao said that reporting of actual cases leads to under-reporting and surveillance data would give a more reliable picture of the HIV scenario. He laughed when told that there has been criticism that NACO has been over-reporting and hyping up HIV and said that on the contrary there was gross under-reporting.,

Unscrupulous processing companies in several countries, acrossEurope and North America, relabelled the contaminated blood as fit for therapeutic use, then sold it on to India and China.,The scandal first came to light when a British AIDS expert, Professor AlanSmith, alerted police of the trade in contaminated blood while he worked inthe virology department of the University of Natal in Durban. Following hiscomplaints, the South African Department of Health brought in WHO expert, DrWilbert Bannenberg, to investigate the issue. Dr Bannenberg uncovered atrail of the unethical trafficking that spanned North America and Europe before ending up in India and China.,Dr Bannenberg's report estimates that in the past decade, the brokers mademore than $ 10 million from processing and re-labelling blood that isdonated free in South Africa as `a gift of life'. Bannenberg found a laxregime of permits for the import and export of blood products. He said thatthe current information on permits in South Africa was ""so vague thatauthorities were unable to determine the source or final destination of theproducts.'' Records of permits between 1997 and 1999 had also mysteriouslyvanished.,Given the scale of South Africa's Aids problem -- almost 3.5 million peopleare infected with AIDS -- and the related fears about blood products from the country, large amounts of human plasma were classified as ""animal plasma'' for export. Dr Bannenberg found documents from 1995, now with Canadian police, which showed 15 shipments of ""animal plasma'' were flown to Belgium, where they were relabelled as human blood from Canada andsold on to a North American company's German plant for processing.,According to The Sunday Times, following a tip-off in 1998, Austrianauthorities seized 4,000 litres of blood from a Linz-based company, AlbovinaAG. The blood was infected with hepatitis B and HIV. The Austrian investigation found that the blood had been shipped to Austria through Guernsey by a South African company. Several blood brokers are due to appear in court in Austria, facing charges of fraudulent trading and endangering public health.,At least two British companies, one based in the tax haven, Guernsey and theother in Berkshire, have been investigated by Austrian detectives.

"Posted:, Tue Oct 03 2000 IST",Nature reports drug-free approach to HIV," , NEW DELHI, OCT 2: A Drug-free approach to treat patients newly infected with HIV was reported by the journal Nature this week.,The finding, which has potentially big research ramifications and has given hopes for a vaccine, is based on a study by immunology researcher Dr Bruce Walker, whose team at Massachusetts General treated a group of very recently infected HIV patients with drugs and then stopped them. With the virus held in check, the immune system developed a vigorous response. In most of the patients, the virus appeared to be under control without drugs, The Wall Street Journal said about the study.,The results of the start-and-stop therapy, though applicable to only a tiny subsection of AIDS patients, intimates that an HIV vaccine might be possible, the WSJ report, authored by this year's Pulitzer prize winning journalist Mark Schoofs said.,The finding by Dr Walker is an offshoot of the celebrated case of the Berlin Patient, in which a young German stopped taking medicine against his doctor's advice and seemed to control his virus. Dr Walker's team studied the patient's immune system. What they found encouraged Dr Walker to proceeed with the study, the first to take patients off drugs, said Schoofs.,The subjects in Dr Walker's study were treated very soon after they contracted HIV, in most cases within a month. Explaining the results, quoting Nature, it says that in these few lucky patients, HIV hasn't had the time to destroy the critical components of the immune system. What Walker's team apparently did was to preserve defences which these patients still had in place. In patients infected for months or years, researchers face a much harder task of regenerating something lost.,Dr Walker and Eric Rosenberg, the principal investigator on the study, say that they fear that many patients won't make this critical distinction and will stop taking their medications. The method used on the study subjects has so far failed to achieve the same results when tried on patients who have carried the virus in their bodies for months or years, the report says.,Another limitation of the study is the durability of the effect of the stop-drug therapy. ""The patients in the study have been controlling the HIV for less than a year. We cannot say what the durability of this effect is. Our patients know we are considering this a honeymoon period,'' says Walker.,The finding echoes the assertions of many AIDS scientists against intake of toxic drug cocktails and their reservations about the very theory of an HIV virus. In fact, a group in the US called Alive and Well, which was started by an HIV-positive person, Christine Maggiore, advocates against using drugs for HIV and AIDS. Maggiore rejected her test and stopped her drugs and went ahead to have a baby. Supported by music band Foo Fighters and featured in the magazine Newsweek last month, the group says that there is no evidence that HIV causes AIDS or that there is an HIV virus. It also says that HIV tests do not test for virus but for antibodies which are in millions in the body and could be generated by conditions as varied as a fever to pregnancy.,

"Posted:, Sun Oct 15 2000 IST",NACO number trick -- Manipur slides from top to bottom on HIV list," , NEW DELHI, OCTOBER 14: The National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), the only national body authorised to make projections about HIV positive cases in the country, has done something remarkable.,When it changed its sampling procedure, Manipur from being the state with the highest rate of HIV positive cases in the country overnight became thestate with the lowest rate. From 177 affected per 1,000 people to 20 per 1,000 (figures for 1998).,The organisation which functions under the Union Health Ministry is yet to give a convincing reason for the roundabout in the figures, nor has it fixed responsibility for it. NACO officials brushed off the mistake on the surveillance system of counting reported HIV cases. Despite repeated calls and a faxed questionnaire, Director J.V.R.Prasada Rao refused to explain the disparity.,According to NACO's earlier statistics, Manipur had witnessed almost doubling of HIV positive cases in the period between 1996 and 1998. NACO reports said the state had 91.52 cases per 1,000 people in 1996 which rocketed to 177 per 1,000 in 1998.,The huge leap is apparently due to some error committed in the sampling.,In 1996, NACO reported that a total of 40,557 people were screened in Manipur for HIV since 1986. Of these 3,712 were found positive. The incidence rate was accordingly calculated as 91.52 per 1,000 people.,In 1998, NACO reported that the total numbers screened since 1986 was only 29,975. No reason was given on how the figures -- which are to be cumulative -- suddenly dropped. The number of HIV positives (again a cumulative figure) were, however, shown to have increased to 5,327. The incidence rate obviously shot up -- to 177.71 per 1,000 people.,The discrepancy in figures were noticed only after a Delhi-based Non-Governmental Organisation JACK raised the issue recently.,Manipur Health Secretary Naba Kishore Singh expressed surprise at the NACO error and said the organisation has no other source of data other than the state AIDS society. And the state had screened 68,000 people until now.,Since July, NACO has officially adopted the system of making estimates on the basis of random blood samples collected at 132 sentinel sites in the country.,While the difference in system can explain the difference in figures for 1998, it still does not explain how the total number of people screened dropped in 1998.,What is significant is, consequent to NACO's report which projected Manipur as being on the verge of an AIDS epidemic, the flow of AIDS-related funds into the organisation and the state increased dramatically.,While grants released for Manipur by NACO in 1997-98 was Rs 150 lakh, it went up to Rs 245 lakh in 1998-99 and to Rs 352.38 lakh in 1999-00.,With Manipur and the entire northeast being projected in such gloomy colours, NACO got funds worth Rs 1,425 crore for the second phase of its National AIDS Control Programme beginning last year. Of this Rs 1,155 crore is a World Bank loan which India must return, and Rs 265 crore is assistance from American and British funding agencies USAID and DFID.,

Pandey former director of the Central Council for Research in Ayurveda and Siddha.,The drugs, which had gold as an ingredient were siddha makaradhwaja and swarna malati basant, said Pandey, who last saw the patients in March end when they had shown improvement. Since then, the trial has been progressing and results have been consistently good, he said.,AFMC, however, is cautious in talking about the results. Principal of the college, Dr V.V. Doiphode said: ""We never claimed that the project, `Management of HIV positive patients with herbo-mineral drugs', is a cure for AIDS.'' ,He did confirm that some patients were administered gold-based drugs. From 1993 to 1995, 25 patients were tested. From 1995 to 1999, another 50 people were included in the project at the Tarachand Hospital which isaffiliated to the Ayurveda College.

The meeting is supported by World Health Organisation and UNAIDS will be attended by researchers from all over the country.,GIFTS is already backing four clinical trials on traditional drugs for AIDS in Africa in alliance with UNAIDS, according to its chairman Gerard Bodekar.The Indian initiative will be in partnership with the Delhi Society for Rational Drug Use whose president Ranjit Ray Choudhury is on the board of GIFTS.,According to Bodekar, the interest being shown in traditional medicine by WHO and UNAIDS indicated a recognition of the fact that modern medicine did not have perfect solutions. ""Besides UNAIDS and WHO know that whether they like it or not, people are turning to alternative remedies for HIV. And so in turn they want quality control in research in alternative medicine.,He said that the experience in the ongoing African trials have been encouraging though they suffer from not maintaining high quality standards.

Vahanvati assured that in case the department found it difficult to provide the treatment, the matter would be placed before the Chief Minister, who would consider granting the necessary funds from the Chief Minister’s Fund as a special case without creating any precedent.

"Posted:, Jul 03, 2002 at 0000 hrs IST",HIV/AIDS and the Big Two," Despite well-documented and successful HIV-prevention programmes in a few countries, the HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to spread in Asia and the Pacific...This region serves as a reminder that no country is immune to a serious HIV epidemic. Low national prevalence rates conceal serious, localised epidemics in several areas, including China and India, where large numbers of people are infected and affected — proof that national HIV prevalence figures do not tell the full story of the epidemic. In fact, the region as a whole is home to more people living with HIV/AIDS than any other besides sub-Saharan Africa — as estimated 6.6 million people at the end of 2001, including the 1 million adults and children who were newly infected with HIV in that year. Less than 30,000 people are on antiretroviral treatment in this region.
,In China, home to a fifth of the world’s people, HIV is moving into new groups of the population and raising the spectre of a much more widespread epidemic. Surveillance data on China’s huge population are sketchy, but it is estimated that around 850,000 Chinese were living with HIV/AIDS in 2001, with reported HIV infections having risen more than 67 per cent in the first six months of 2001.
,Several HIV epidemics are being observed among certain population groups in different parts of this vast country. Serious localised HIV epidemics are occurring among injecting drug users in at least seven provinces, with prevalence rates higher than 70 per cent among injecting drug users in areas such as Yili Prefecture in Xinjiang and Ruili County in Yunnan. Another nine provinces are possibly on the brink of similar HIV epidemics because of very high rates of needle-sharing...
,Several other factors highlight the need for swift action if a much more serious epidemic is to be prevented. Reported sexually transmitted infections increased significantly from 430,000 cases in 1997 to 860,000 cases in 2000. This suggests that unprotected sex with non-monogamous partners is on the rise in China. In addition, massive population mobility...and increasing socio-economic disparities add to the likelihood of wider HIV spread...
,India’s national adult HIV prevalence rate was under 1 per cent, yet this meant that an estimated 3.97 million Indians were living with HIV/AIDS — more than in any other country besides South Africa. The epidemic is spreading more than general population and beyond groups with high-risk behaviour. Indeed, median HIV prevalence among women attending antenatal clinics was higher than 2 per cent in Andhra Pradesh and exceeded 1 per cent in four other states (Karnataka, Maharashtra, Manipur and Tamil Nadu). India’s epidemic is also strikingly diverse, both among and within states.

"Posted:, Oct 04, 2002 at 0000 hrs IST,WASHINGTON, OCTOBER 3:",‘HIV drugs for Africa diverted to Europe’," Nearly $18 million worth of HIV drugs intended for impoverished Africans have been intercepted by profiteers and shipped back to Europe to be sold at marked-up prices, says a report.,As a result, nearly a quarter of the supply of the anti-retroviral drug Combivir has not reached Africans in the last year, said the drug’s manufacturer, Glaxo SmithKline. Instead, two other Glaxo HIV drugs were sold in Germany, the Netherlands, UK and Switzerland by European wholesalers.,Though some of the drugs were shipped from a Glaxo factory in France and arrived in Africa, the shipment ‘‘never made it out of the airport before it was turned back around by these wholesalers to Europe,’’ spokesman for the Dutch Health Care Inspector’s office Raymond Salet said.,The diversion appears to have worked this way, according to Dutch and Glaxo officials: Glaxo used air freight companies to transport the medicine to Africa. Then the shipments were moved from one company to another that performs for custom clearance. They were then sent to an air freight service employed by the profiteers and flown to Europe.,Delivered to wholesalers, the drugs made their way into the regular chain of commerce. Because the drugs were identical to European versions, ‘‘the pharmacists who bought them could innocently have thought they were their usual orders,’’ Salet said.,After AIDS activists agitated by to improve access to treatment in developing countries, Glaxo had discounted Combivir, which costs between $4 and $6 a pill in Western Europe, to 80 cents a pill in sub-Saharan Africa, where an estimated 28.5 million people are infected with the HIV.,The diverted medicines were intended for use in Congo Republic, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Togo and Guinea-Bissau. ‘‘We been fighting so hard to get these medicines, and for someone to take them from the hands of people who are dying, to make money for themselves, it’s terrible, a scandal,’’ Deputy Chief of Staff to Ivory Coast President Sarata Ottro Zirignon-Toure said.,The scheme involving Glaxo’s products has been going on since July 2001 which were, however, undetected. It prompted authorities to search and seize shipping records and computer files. Glaxo estimates that 28 shipments of Combivir, Epivir and Trizivir were diverted through July of this year, totaling close to 3 million doses.

"Posted:, Dec 01, 2002 at 0000 hrs IST",HIV: Drug-resistant and Dangerous," The success of Indian pharmaceuticals in developing antiretro- virals, which limit the damage HIV can do to the immune system, may have drastically reduced the cost of treatment but researchers warn of resulting complications in India.,Because HIV can mutate quickly to counter the effects of only one antiretroviral drug (monotherapy), a cocktail therapy of several drugs is recommended so that the virus has to change severally to counter their effects. With Indian drugs available comparatively cheaply, Indian HIV patients have relatively better access to a combination of three or more drugs of the ‘highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)’.,But, according to Dr S B Vaidya and his colleagues in the Department of Dermatovenereology and AIDS Medicine, GT Hospital and Grant Medical College, Mumbai, unless these drugs are used judiciously, treatment failures will cause the emergence of drug-resistant HIV strains. The doctors warn of this grave danger that is already making its presence felt in the US.,The August issue of The New England Journal of Medicine reported an increase in the transmission rate of drug-resistant HIV. Researchers at the School of Medicine, University of California, who conducted the study, said that one in every five new HIV cases is drug-resistant. Doctors in the Mumbai hospital apprehend precisely this trend in India. ‘‘This is a grave danger not only to India but to the entire world. So far, antiretrovirals have had only a limited impact in India. ,HIV-infected patients require multidimensional care and the success of antiretroviral therapy depends on numerous economic, social, cultural, political, technical and infrastructural factors,’’ they say in their latest research paper.

"Posted:, Nov 17, 2002 at 0000 hrs IST",‘20 million HIV victims by 2010? These are wild projections’," What do you make of the hype over AIDS numbers in India?People have been talking of nothing else since I came here. Everyone asks the same thing: Will India have 20 million HIV/AIDS victims by 2010? I think these are wild projections. The Indian situation cannot be compared to Africa’s. There are health systems in place here and Indian government is aware of the seriousness of the problem. In some states like Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, remarkable interventions have been planned.,Having said that, I feel that India does not need to downplay the problem either. The prevalence rate of HIV in India is not very high; it’s estimated to be around 0.7 per cent. And I have no cause to doubt that figure. But if you look at it in terms of the country’s population, it becomes a huge figure.,I think a lot of people are making a big noise with the objective of jostling the government into dramatic action. But it doesn’t seem to be working out that way. Given the government’s reaction, I don’t think such statements go down very well with them.,How exactly does the world community view the extent of this problem in India?The world is watching India very closely. Apart from high-profile people  like Bill Gates making statements and investing in healthcare in India, world leaders are concerned about the African experience being repeated in Asia. I was appointed as a UN Special Representative for HIV/AIDS in Asia. This is where a large chunk of the world population lives. So naturally there is concern.,Despite the hype about AIDS, patients still get thrown out of the hospital. Don’t you think the real solution lies in improving healthcare infrastructure, instead of concentrating on specific diseases in isolation?You are absolutely right. In any case, the government cannot do everything. They should concentrate on areas like strengthening healthcare infrastructure and let the NGOs do advocacy and raise awareness. The corporate sector needs to be involved in making HIV victims self-reliant. Established sectors like the Railways can also help in this area.,You seem to be quite convinced that the government is actually doing something, and the AIDS figures are exaggerated.I definitely think that the Indian government is far more involved than they appear to be. They need to talk about some of the things they are doing. You see, in a large country like India, the exact numbers will never be known. But at least there is a realisation that the disease is spreading. The Indian government needs to talk about what they are doing a bit more loudly.

Tests of the vaccine on mice is at an advanced stage, Sharma said.,The DNA rabies vaccine developed by scientists at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, and tested for commercial production by a pharma has entered the human trial phase and will be released soon, Sharma said.,The new low cost vaccine will be the first of its kind and will revolutionise rabies treatment, she claimed. Indian scientists are also developing a new vaccine for cholera and TB.,The Department of Biotechnology has been allocated Rs 1,500 crore under the 10th Plan for work on functional genomics, bio-informatics, vaccine missions and documentation of bio-reserves in the country, Sharma said.,Nearly half the work of identifying and classifying the country’s bio-reserves has been completed.

"Posted:, Dec 08, 2002 at 0000 hrs IST",Positive about HIV," A narrow lane leads to what appears to be just another house in the thickly populated neighbourhood of Yaiskul Police Lane in Imphal. Three huge posters addressing adherents of Hinduism, Christianity and Islam greet the newcomer as he walks upstairs into an elegantly decorated room where a group of young men and women are discussing everyday life over cups of tea.
,But it’s not just another house and the group around the table is not just another bunch of youngsters. ‘‘All of us in this room are HIV-positive,’’ says L Deepak Singh, tall and handsome and general secretary of the Manipur Network for People with HIV/AIDS.
,                           Members of the Manipur         Network for People with HIV/AIDS: Fighting more than a disease          In a state where HIV is fast assuming epidemic proportions, this five-year-old group, which works closely with the Manipur State Aids Control Society, has no qualms about acknowledging its members’ positivity. They believe their openness will help the society they live in as also those who share their status. ‘‘An HIV-positive person might be hesitant to confide in people as the in-group and out-of-the-group philosophy comes into play. But the moment we tell him about our HIV status, there’s an instant feeling of trust,’’ says Deepak, 34.
,With branches in seven of the state’s nine districts, the Manipur Network has more than 200 HIV-positive people working as volunteers. Each of their centres has care staff and counsellors to guide HIV-positive people. ‘‘We focus on looking at life beyond the disease. Life doesn’t end with the infection,’’ says 40-year-old Banta Singh, president of the organisation and architectural engineer. ‘‘We want to tell people that they can lead long and healthy lives with the right intervention and the proper diet.’’
,It might sound simple enough, but as any member of the group will say, it’s an uphill job all the way. ‘‘HIV-positive people face discrimination even from the educated and the aware,’’ says Banta. ‘‘One day in our Chennai office, a friend slipped and broke his nose. As we were running about, trying to organise an ambulance, the neighbours — all well-educated professionals — came to know about our HIV status. And nobody came forward to help. Worse, they insisted that we vacate the premises. Fortunately, our landlady stood by us.’’
,According to Bobby, a 37-year-old lawyer now working full time with the organisation, the baggage is comparatively much less in Manipur. ‘‘In a state with an alarmingly high incidence of HIV, every family knows an HIV-positive person,’’ he points out. ‘‘So the stigma is less. Despite that, when we formed our group in 1997, we had to keep moving from one office to another, with our files packed into that tin trunk. Finally, after two years, we could set up office over here.’’
,But ‘‘settling down’’ had its own problems. ‘‘We lived with the constant fear of getting caught as, around that time, some groups had taken it upon themselves to punish drug-addicts. Most of our members, by the way, contracted the virus through intravenous drug use,’’ says Deepak. ‘‘Declaring one’s status was a big risk.’’
,Deepak himself came out publicly with his status when a couple came to him crying after they had tested positive for HIV. ‘‘No amount of counselling could convince them that they could lead normal lives until I presented myself as an example,’’ he says.
,While encouraging openness, the group emphasises that declaring one’s status must be contingent on a proper back-up system. ‘‘Since this is a small place, everyone knows everyone else. A daughter of one of our counsellors faced constant taunts from her classmates because of the HIV-status of her parents. So she had to go to school to take up the matter,’’ says Yukami, whose husband died of AIDS.
,Just as children are cause for concern, so are women. ‘‘If a man dies of AIDS, his parents will hold her responsible for the death. They think women get infected only due to errant behaviour,’’ says Yukami. ‘‘Society is more than a little biased against women.’’
,The group also believes the media have a major role to play in removing these misconceptions. ‘‘The image portrayed by the media when the disease first came to light gave people a very wrong impression of the disease. Even if people don’t stigmatise the victim, the stigma towards the disease persists,’’ says Banta.
,‘‘We are doing our work, but we’ll know things have changed only when the world treats HIV as just another disease, not a taboo,’’ adds Bobby. On that note, the discussion draws to a close. But the quiet determination in the air refuses to fade away.

"Posted:, Dec 08, 2002 at 0000 hrs IST,Pune: ","Forget Horoscopes, Match HIV Tests ","                           Sarpanch Popatrao Pawar         addressing a village meeting         AIDS has almost come knocking on its doors and somehow not made its way in. But Hiware Bazar, a village with a population of 1,200 located about 125 km from Pune, knows that’s more by luck than by design. Now it’s changing that. Even as you read this, 17 boys and girls of the village eligible for marriage may be undergoing voluntary Enzyme Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA) test for HIV. They have also vowed that before they get married, they will not only match horoscopes but also demand that their partners undergo similar tests.
,Hiware Bazar, which falls in Ahmednagar district, knows it needs all the precautions it can take. In the past couple of years, there have been five to six cases of AIDS every year in some of its neighbouring villages. The Pune-Nagar highway dhabas which attract travellers from outside these villages are believed to be the main culprits. Hiware Bazar has so far remained untouched.
,A large part of it is thanks to its sarpanch, Popatrao Pawar, and his progressive views. According to him, the idea to make tests a pre-condition for marriage was suggested to him by a Class XI girl. ‘‘The idea came about when students of the village school were asked to write an essay on how the village has changed and what hope the students held for the future. A Standard XI girl mentioned that due to the growing threat of AIDS, a test to check for HIV should be made compulsory before marriages. I thought I should find out if other women of the village too felt this way and they did.’’ A gram sabha held on December 1, World AIDS Day, made the decision formal.
,The gram sabha also resolved to make all the girls and boys eligible for marriage undergo ELISA tests. ‘‘There was no compulsion and they agreed,’’ says Pawar. ‘‘I know it is a sensitive issue, so we are still in the process of finalising it. But people here know what AIDS is and the problems it can cause.’’
,The youngsters agree the move is a progressive decision. Manjula Bangar (20) says: ‘‘I have seen what AIDS can do on television and at the NSS camp held here, they gave us more information. I will only marry a man who will agree to undergo an HIV test. If he does not agree, I’d rather not marry him.’’
,Adds 18-year-old Rohini Thange: ‘‘A test is necessary. If we can match horoscopes before we marry, we should also match test results.’’
,Even parents like Chandralekha Thange, mother of the 20-year-old Jayashree,  see the wisdom in it. ‘‘Someone we know in the neighbouring village died of AIDS. I think the test is a good decision. All of us support it. If Jayshree gets a good marriage proposal, but the boy refuses a test, then we too will say no,’’ she says.
,‘‘This is the need of the hour,’’ feels farmer Ramesh Pawar. ‘‘When the village has agreed to safeguard its youngsters, there is no question of going back on it. Both my sons shall undergo the test when they are to get married.’’
,Sarpanch Pawar adds that unlike politicians who are afraid that such a policy may boomerang, the gram panchayat has no such fears. ‘‘We now plan to approach the government for help in subsiding the cost of the ELISA tests and to give us facilities to increase awareness,’’ says Pawar. ‘‘It could be seen as casting aspersions on the character of a boy or girl by demanding such a test. But we are safeguarding the lives of villagers and spreading awareness about AIDS. We are aware that we need to change the mindset of people, but one has to make a beginning somewhere.’’ 
,Adds a proud Pawar: ‘‘We cannot control what happens in our neighbouring villages. But since most marriages in the village take place in a radius of 25 km, we can at least safeguard our youngsters.’’

Her luck changed after she quit an assignment with UNAIDS in New Delhi early last year and joined the Assam State Aids Control Society. ,Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi today handed her the keys of a one-room apartment, belonging to the Assam State Housing Board, at Dispur. The board will not charge Goswami any rent.,‘‘This is the end of a long search for a house of my own ever since I was compelled to leave my husband’s house,’’ Goswami said. She briefly lived with her parents in Kampur after being thrown out. ,‘‘It has been very difficult looking for a house on rent since society isn’t ready to accept people like me.’’ Her dwellings secured, she has decided to work with more vigour on spreading awareness about AIDS. ,‘‘Lessons on HIV/AIDS should be introduced in high schools so that the younger generation, which is the most vulnerable, gets aware,’’ Goswami told The Indian Express.,Chief Minister Gogoi has also awarded a grant of Rs 50,000 to repair Goswami’s 225 sq ft apartment. ‘‘This is the best gift I have ever given anybody in my life. It’s also a new year gift from the people to Jahnavi,’’ Gogoi beamed as cameras clicked away. He admitted that the AIDS awareness campaign in Assam hadn’t made its desired impact yet. ,‘‘I have asked the Aids Control Society to gear up its activities.

Doctors are blaming the ‘‘window period’’ for the tragic incident.,During the ‘‘window period’’— it could last from two to 20 years — HIV antibodies may not show up in an infected person, complicating the task of screening blood donors and increasing the risk of recipients.,Imtiaz Chauhan was brought to the hospital for repair of an ano-rectal defect, an operation that required blood transfusion.,His parents, Ashraf and Roshanben Chauhan of Savarkundla, arranged for blood from the blood bank at Rajkot Medical College.,Adhering to standard procedure, the bank provided them blood from a donor who had tested HIV negative.,But Imtiaz was later found to be infected with the HIV virus. As his parents tested HIV negative, doctors narrowed the source of the child’s infection to the transfusion.,They are assuming that the other route of infection — during surgical procedure — is unlikely. But medical experts say that in such a case, this route should not be ruled out with such certainty.,For now, doctors at the blood bank and the hospital are blaming the ‘‘window period’’.,Dr G.A. Dhruva of the blood bank says neither the bank nor the hospital is to blame. ‘‘This seems to be a case of window period. At the time of transfusion, no HIV antibodies were found in the donor’s blood,’’ she said.,Dhruva said the donor was a relative of another patient at the hospital. She said rules not only forbid revealing the donor’s name but also hold them from informing the donor that he is an HIV carrier and could be running the risk of turning HIV positive or developing full-blown AIDS.,Didn’t this mean that the donor could unknowingly continue to infect others, should he continue to donate?,‘‘At a recent meeting of doctors with Union Minister of State for Human Resources Dr Vallabh Kathiriya, we had raised this point. We had wanted banks to be allowed to recall a person suspected to be in the window period and test him again, for his own good and to prevent others being infected,’’ she says.,However, there are no clear rules on these tricky factors at present, says Dr Nabajyoti Chaudhury, an expert in transfusions based in Ahmedabad.,‘‘But very soon everything will be drawn up in black and white, including instructions on counselling of donors and recipients, even on recalling donors if there is the chance they may be carriers,’’ he says.,At the K T Children’s Hospital, senior doctors — from the medical superintendent to the paediatrics in-charge — have been on leave for over a week. Doctors on duty refuse to comment, saying Imtiaz is ‘‘not their case.’’,That has left Imtiaz’s parents bewildered: it hasn’t sunk in yet that their child now suffers from a life-long, dreaded illness.,‘‘Aa kai bimari chey? (What is this disease?)’’ his mother Roshanben asked. ‘‘Dr B. Ganatra, who operated on my son, told us ... (that the child has tested HIV positive.)’’,Both Ashraf and Roshanben say they weren’t counselled on the risk of surgery and blood transfusion. Something doctors say should have been done.,‘‘In this case the possibility of window period cannot be ruled out, but it is the hospital authorities’ duty to advise patients on risk of blood transfusion etc,’’ says Dr Manorama Mehta, a former superintendent of the hospital. Dr Ganatra was unavailable for comment.

"Posted:, Jul 28, 2003 at 0000 hrs IST,NEW DELHI, JULY 27:",HIV fight to start from villages," If things proceed as planned, December 1, 2003, is going to be a special day. That day, all panchayats in the country are likely to hold sessions to formulate an AIDS policy in their respective villages. This was decided at the two-day convention of the Indian Parliamentarians’ Forum on HIV/AIDS,  which ended in the capital this evening.,The convention saw politicians cutting across party lines resolving to fight the disease collectively. These elected representatives urged the need for a comprehensive legislation to protect human rights of those affected with the deadly virus and also for a policy on both the central and state levels to fight the disease.,‘‘The Prime Minister had said that there was a possibility of holding a special session of Parliament on HIV/AIDS in the near future,’’ Oscar Fernandes, Convenor of the forum, said. According to him, the session was important as it would be utilised to draft a Bill dealing with issues of rights of the HIV-infected people so that they are not discriminated against.,The Bill is likely to deal with issues like accessibility of treatment and mandatory testing before marriage. It will also focus on taking care of infected people with a special focus on palliative care. ,The participants also insisted on the need to lower costs and withdraw sales tax and customs duty on anti-retroviral drugs as providing these free of cost may not be possible in the near future. These drugs cost about Rs 1,500 and Rs 1,800 per month and if the duties are withdrawn, the cost would come down to about Rs 1,000 per month.,Delhi Chief Minister Shiela Dikshit, however, expressed her concern about controlling the disease in view of the heavy migration into the city from other states. ‘‘This peculiar situation requires the people of the Capital to be more aware than they are at present,’’ she maintained.,Reiterating the need for easy availability of treatment, she said that the Delhi government was trying to ensure that hospital infrastructure and health care personnel were more responsive to the treatment and care of people living with the virus.

,As eyes in the Vigyan Bhawan hall, where the Indian Parliamentary Forum on HIV/AIDS, started moving, Koushalya, president of Positive Women’s Network of South India, made her statement.
,‘‘You can see a lot of my friends in black T-shirts. They are from various networks of people living with HIV/AIDS. Black symbolises mourning, but for us wearing black marks our protest in silence,’’ she said.
,‘‘The findings of a country-wide survey on stigma and discrimination conducted by us brings out instances of discrimination and violation of rights, mainly in the healthcare system,’’ she said and narrated instances of non-accessibility and high cost of HIV treatment. 
,A resident of Namakkal in Tamil Nadu, she got the infection from her truck driver husband known to have a history of visiting prostitutes. Detected with the disease a few months into the marriage, Koushalya, who is living with HIV/AIDS for the past eight years now, had just one question to ask. ‘‘I am on anti-retroviral drugs for three years now and am healthy. How am I different than anybody else?’’ she said.
,Koushalya found support in the PM as well as Health Minister Sushma Swaraj. Calling HIV/AIDS a global challenge, the PM said it was a national concern that demanded effective response. Though he admitted the country’s response to the epidemic has been ‘‘somewhat belated’’, he said it was gaining in strength with each passing month.
,“The growing Parliamentary activism on HIV/ AIDS is welcome for an additional reason. It not only helps the fight against the disease itself, but will also make our elected representatives more sensitive to other health challenges,’’ Vajpayee told the convention.
,Sushma called for a ‘red revolution’ to ensure each unit of blood was safe. In his message, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said the convention was a historical event as it was the biggest gathering of political leaders in the world. 
,Congress chief Sonia Gandhi hit out at the government for ‘‘slow’’ progress in extending health insurance cover to the people.

"Posted:, Jul 17, 2003 at 0000 hrs IST,PARIS, JULY 16:",1 in 10 European HIV patients resistant to drugs," One in 10 HIV patients in Europe newly infected with the virus is infected with drug-resistant strains, researchers said on Wednesday.,Experts said the biggest study of its kind, presented at an international conference in Paris, showed the need for patients to adhere strictly to drug regimens and for companies to develop a constant stream of new medicines to keep AIDS at bay.,Resistance has long been viewed as a serious problem in AIDS hot spots such as San Francisco, where more than a quarter of patients are drug resistant, but the scale of the problem has not, until now, been monitored across such a large area.,David van de Vijver of University Medical Center Utrecht, Netherlands, said the scale of the problem in Europe was a concern. ‘‘The conclusion of our study is that 10 per cent of newly diagnosed patients in Europe are infected with a virus that contains resistance to at least one anti-retroviral drug,’’ he told reporters.,The study, covering 1,633 patients from 17 European countries, also found that 1.7 per cent of new patients were resistant to two or more anti-retrovirals. Non-adherence to drug treatment regimens is the main reason for the emergence of drug resistance.,But Van de Vijver said its worrying spread in Europe also suggested many people on treatment were returning to high-risk behaviour, such as engaging in unprotected sex and sharing hypodermic needles.,Joep Lange, president of the International AIDS Society, said drug resistance would never be eradicated because of the ability of HIV to mutate swiftly. ‘‘That means we need to develop new drugs all the time and that also means that we need to keep research-based (pharmaceuticals companies) interested in HIV because if they are not interested any longer there will be a point of time when we are in a desperate situation,’’ he said.,Lange rejected as ‘‘totally ridiculous’’ suggestions that the risk of resistance was a reason not to supply anti-retrovirals to the developing world, where drug supplies and medical care may be less reliable.,Kevin Frost, director of the Treat Asia network working to roll out treatment in Asia, said the European study showed the need to get proper ‘‘triple therapy’’ treatments into poor countries.,‘‘If we don’t get it right we could be in for serious long-term problems in developing countries,’’ he said. There are currently 19 separate anti-HIV drugs in the market, falling into three main classes: nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors.,Van de Vijver said resistance was found to the first class in 6.9 per cent of the European patient group, resistance to the second class in 2.6 per cent and resistance to protease inhibitors in 2.2 per cent.,Researchers and pharmaceutical companies are working to develop a range of new medicines to attack the virus in novel ways. These include several drugs designed to block HIV’s entry into healthy cells. The first of these, a so-called fusion inhibitor called Fuzeon from Switzerland’s Roche Holding AG and US Biotech Trimeris Inc., was recently launched in Europe and the US.,Other companies are also working on so-called integrase inhibitors, designed to block another step in the life cycle of HIV, although these are only at an early stage of development.

"Posted:, Oct 05, 2003 at 0000 hrs IST,NEW DELHI, OCTOBER 4",HIV-positive children will get free drugs ," The Government is embarking on an ambitious project to provide anti-retroviral drugs to HIV-positive children below 14 years of age free of cost. This will enhance their life and help them fight the virus for a long time.
,As the non-availability and high cost of the medicines (Rs 5,000 per month) are said to be the major gap in the AIDS control programme in the country, the Government is touting it as a major step forward. The initiative will be included in the next phase of the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO)  programme and is likely to start in three-to-six months’ time.
,It’s a huge commitment. Out of the estimated 3.9 to 4.5 million HIV-positive cases in India, around 2 lakh are believed to be children. And even if half of them need anti-retroviral drugs, the annual spending will be Rs 600 crore. Though the total annual budget of the Health Ministry is just Rs 225 crore, it expects Rs 500 crore global funding and another $100 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
,Anti-retroviral drug is the only way an HIV-positive person can live longer. ‘‘But most die due to non-availability of the drugs and our major concern is the increasing number of children who contract the illness from their parents. Most of them are orphans or have both parents affected with the virus, so this group was given priority,’’ says Sushma Swaraj, Health and Family Welfare Minister.
,Though the Government has no estimates of the budget or the number of people to be covered, it plans to issue a mass appeal for voluntary registration as a first step. ‘‘If we hold a survey to estimate the number, it might or might not be conclusive. However, the fact that the medicines would be available for free will help people declare their HIV status to the concerned authorities,’’ the minister says.
,According to experts, being HIV-positive doesn’t mean that a person is eligible for the anti-retroviral drugs. ‘‘A person is given the drugs only when the immunity drops and CD count is below 200,’’ says a NACO official. The state AIDS control organisations have been asked to identify hospitals where the registration can be done.
,The minister is meeting the pharma companies next week to discuss the reduction of prices for anti-retroviral drugs in view of the bulk purchase.

Vajpayee requires the details for his November 21 meeting with former US president Bill Clinton who is coming here on a two-day trip. Clinton will be visiting India for the second time, albeit in his ‘‘capacity as an individual’’ and not as a former head of the US. Both the American Embassy and the Government deny having any precise information about the visit.,The subject of his discussion with the PM would, however, be AIDS. The interest in the disease is expected as Clinton is also an honorary Chairperson of the American India Foundation (AIF). AIF is ‘‘committed to provide financial, technological and managerial resources to Indians to strengthen the bond between the US and India’’.,AIF’s grants are focused on education and livelihood projects with emphasis on primary education and women’s empowerment. The Foundation also operates two programs: the Service Corps, which places skilled Americans with NGOs in India for development work; and the Digital Equaliser which provides computers, software, Internet access and training to children and teachers in underprivileged schools in India.,The purpose of the visit becomes clear by the fact that health-related issues figure high on his itinerary. Besides speaking to the PM, Clinton will attend a meeting organised by pharmaceutical company Ranbaxy. The Clinton Foundation had recently entered into an agreement with three pharmaceutical companies in India — Ranbaxy, Cipla and Matrix — to lower the prices of drugs, especially the anti-retroviral drugs for AIDS. ,Sources say, Clinton is also likely to visit the Taj Mahal again on November 22.,Meanwhile, the presidential suite at Maurya Sheraton is being prepared for the celebrity guest it was named after. It has been booked in Clinton’s name from November 20 to 22. The chefs are already on the job as Clinton has expressed his desire to have Bukhara again.

"Posted:, Jan 18, 2004 at 0000 hrs IST",Romance could be HIV medicine," PEOPLE infected with the AIDS virus live longer if they are in stable sexual relationships, a new study reports.
,The findings, which also show a slower progression of the disease for people in these relationships, are in keeping with past studies that have established links between emotional health and physical health.
,‘‘Social support, the emotional or tangible support available from other people,’’ the authors wrote, ‘‘is one of the primary ways in which social relationships influence health.’’
,People who live alone, the study noted, are more likely to die of cardiovascular disease than are those who do not. But the researchers were curious how well the link applied to people with HIV.
,The study, led by Dr Heiner C Bucher of the Basel Institute for Clinical Epidemiology in Switzerland, appears in BMJ, a British medical journal.
,The researchers followed more than 3,700 infected people, 71 per cent male, over five years. Every six months, the volunteers were asked whether they were in stable sexual relationships. At the start of the study, 52 per cent said they were. By the end, the figure had dropped to 46 per cent. (Eighty per cent reported being in a stable relationship at least once during the study.)
,The study cited several explanations. Social support may actually have physical effects on the body and its disease-fighting mechanisms. Or it may ward off depression and anxiety, which can weaken a body’s defences. A good relationship may also encourage people to take their prescriptions and to avoid unhealthy actions.

And he’s possibly not the only one to have contracted the AIDS virus.
,The morgue status report, a copy of which was obtained by The Indian Express, lists the cause of death as ‘‘cardio-respiratory failure in a case of dilated cardiomyopathy with heart failure and HIV infection’’.
,Detection of the deadly virus and the continuing stalemate over completion of the last rites for the departed footballer raised crucial questions among the city’s football community. Many pleaded for greater health check for foreign players flocking to the city’s football outfits and greater monitoring of their stay here.
,‘‘Many of the players from Africa lead unhealthy lives, so the news is not surprising. We in Kolkata recruit footballers from Africa in a large number — at present we have about 12 African footballers registered with various clubs and there are a quite a few unregistered footballers also. There should be stricter medical checks for them,’’said Swapan Ball, East Bengal’s football manager.
,On Wednesday, the ordeal for the deceased and a host of his countrymen in Kolkata seemed far from over. However, his peers have decided to hold an exhibition match on Friday between an Africa XI and East Bengal.
,Mohammedan Sporting, where Lawrence had played in 2000, said that the club had little to do. Club secretary Sultan Ahmed said Lawrence had played for them just one year before playing in Tripura and so Mohammedan Sporting couldn’t be held responsible for the ordeal.
,Lawrence, who latterly made a living by playing matches on contract, was admitted to a city nursing home on February 6 with breathing trouble and other complications. He died the next day. Since then, his body has been lying at a mortuary for lack of funds. Though some contributions have come in, it’s not enough for the body to be sent home, said Bernard Oparanozie, a Nigerian footballer who used to play for Mohammedan AC.
,Sultan says Lawrence’s sister was expected in Kolkata by Saturday and the body may have to be kept at the mortuary till her arrival. The question of the body being taken back to his country appears remote.
,For the 32-year-old Nigerian footballer who had once put his best foot forward in the soccer championships of Kolkata, it has been a rather harsh end to life.
,Bernard, who was coordinating efforts to send Lawrence’s body back home  said :”We raised some money but that was not enough. And there is now the risk of sending the body because it is decomposing and it’s a long trip. We are going to Delhi tomorrow to meet Nigerian High Commission officials with the fax message that we got from Lawrence’s father and we will seek the permission to bury the body here,’’ Bernard said.
,S. B. Mandal, sports secretary, government of West Bengal, said that nobody had approached the government with request for help. ‘‘If anybody seeks our help the government will definitely come forward,’’ Mandal told this reporter.

For two weeks, the body of the 32-year-old Nigerian footballer had been lying in a city mortuary; today, as his friends and compatriots looked on, he was buried at Bhowanipore Cemetery in Kolkata.,Lawrence, who had played for Mohammedan Sporting, among other clubs, had died on February 7 (he was HIV-positive) but lay in Peace Haven funeral parlour because his friends could not raise enough money to send the body to his homeland. His parents expressed their inability to travel to India and gave their permission to his friends to arrange for his burial in Kolkata itself.,Present at the short, simple ceremony were leading city footballers including East Bengal captain Mike Okoro, Bernard Oparanozie, Christopher, other friends of Lawrence and two officials from Nigerian High Commission who flew in from New Delhi.,‘‘We thank everybody who helped us in arranging for the burial of our friend’’, Bernard, who’d taken the lead in arranging the funeral, told The Sunday Express. ‘‘It would have been better if we could send the body but what do you do?’’,Lawrence’s death has raised the larger issue of foreigners, especially Africans, playing football for Kolkata clubs without much regulation. Kolkata’s football officials have already expressed their concern at an African footballer contracting the deadly virus but say off the record that they were unable to do much to regulate the number of foreigners playing on the Maidan.

The shutdown followed an urgent plea by health advocates to halt unprotected sex in the porn industry.,The positive tests have reverberated throughout the industry, sparking a mix of anxiety and indifference at industry movie sets, talent agencies and testing clinics. Vivid and other companies announced that they would stop filming in hopes of heading off an outbreak of HIV in the multi-billion-dollar business.,Production would stop until those actors who had worked with Gonzo porn star Darren James and actress partner Lara Roxx could be tested, company officials said. But other companies dismissed the plea for a moratorium, calling it ‘‘paranoid’’ and ‘‘knee-jerk,’’ and vowed to keep their cameras rolling. The industry, they said, was perfectly safe.,The call for a halt to filming of sex scenes without a condom was made by the Sherman Oaks-based Adult Industry Medical Heath Care Foundation, which listed on its website about three dozen actors who may have been exposed to the virus recently, and urged them to get tested.,Other top adult-entertainment groups, including the leading news website, endorsed the proposal. James, one of the actors with HIV, reportedly contracted the virus in Brazil and has worked for producers who don’t require condoms. At World Modelling Talent Agency in Sherman Oaks, which represents many adult actors, the phones hadn’t stopped ringing.,Dr Jonathan Fielding, director of public health for Los Angeles County, said that although the porn industry in general has been diligent about screening actors for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases, the root problem is the continued practice of unsafe sex. On Thursday, actors and actresses streaming in and out of the AIM Healthcare Foundation’s office to get tested for HIV said they felt unnerved. 	—(LAT-WP)

Rago  said the problem was detected in routine tests WHO conducts among drugs it finds acceptable for procurement by UN agencies. But, he said, the problem is not expected to interfere with WHO’s initiative to treat 3 million HIV-infected people, mostly in Africa, by next year.,Cipla, an Indian company that has been in the forefront of getting generic drugs approved for use, made the two generic drugs, lamivudine, also known as 3TC, and zidovudine, known as AZT.,The move comes after the Bush administration’s announcement of a shift in its AIDS policy to allow the purchase of cheaper generic drugs for Africa and the Caribbean. Cipla said the situation was ‘‘on the mend’’ and expected its drugs to be back on the list within weeks.,The problem was detected during an inspection of an independent laboratory Cipla had hired to conduct bioequivalence studies among volunteers whose blood had been tested after they took the generic drugs. Rago did not name the company that did the testing.,A review found that the company’s documents did not meet the standards known as good clinical and laboratory practice. Despite the findings, the generic drugs may be bioequivalent to the patented drugs. However, WHO had to remove them as the documentation was lacking, Rago said.,Cipla’s chairman, Dr. Yusuf K. Hamied, said the problem was that the laboratory in Mumbai did not keep adequate records. He said Cipla’s lamivudine has already been tested for bioequivalency in a US laboratory and is approved by the FDA and that he will submit that data to WHO. He said the testing was done for the US drug agency as Cipla hopes to sell generic lamivudine when the US patent expires in 2006.,WHO did not issue a news release about the problem after it was detected in May. Rago said such an announcement was unnecessary as his agency had informed other UN agencies about the problem. 	— (NYT)

The organisation has noted this trend in its centres spread across 13 states and 60 districts. According to the figures, the organisation was helping 6,000 AIDS-affected people since it was formed in 1997. But it has registered at least 4,000 more patients in the past six months.,‘‘People have heard about the free treatment and are coming forward and declaring their positive status in the hope of getting free drugs,’’ says Abraham Kurien, president of the Indian Network of Positive People.,The Women’s Group has also witnessed a similar trend. The trend is confirmed by international organisations as well. Julian V. Howes, the Interim Regional Coordinator of the Global Network of Positive People, says: ‘‘The availability of ARV therapy is one of the things that can lead a person to confirm his HIV status.’’ But there are conflicting figures in the 2004 Report on Global AIDS on the number of deaths. ‘‘When there are no exact numbers with the government, how can it give the number of estimated deaths,’’ said a NGO member.,The project for providing free medicines, the brainchild of former health minister Sushma Swaraj, has not found favour with the new government. In the past six months, just 900 people have been put on therapy. ‘‘If the people keep on registering, and there is no promise of medicine, the numbers might start decreasing again,’’ says Ramachandran. ‘‘The medicine, if discontinued after starting, can be fatal,’’ he adds.

Africa continued to have the world’s highest incidence of AIDS, but Eastern Europe and Central Asia are suffering from the fastest rate of growth in HIV infections, officials said.,Prevention has been inadequate in Asia ‘‘partly because of stigma and discrimination,’’ the report said, adding that 7.4 million people are living with HIV in Asia.

According to National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), the rate of growth of HIV cases in India has come down this year with high prevalence states like Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh joining combat in a big way.,NACO figures show that the rate of growth of HIV infections has fallen from 13.3 per cent in 2002 to 10.18 per cent in 2003. Against an increase of 6.1 lakh HIV cases in 2002, data for 2003 shows an increase of 5.2 lakh cases: a downward trend.,Confirming this, NACO Project Director Meenakshi Datta Ghosh told The Indian Express: ‘‘In 2002, cases accelerated rapidly but in 2003 there are signs of stabilisation among the general population in the six high-prevalence states. Increasing awareness about HIV and AIDS is a major reason. We are happy because our intervention for prevention and low cost care has had an impact.’’,But India with 5.1 million has the largest number of people living with HIV outside South Africa, according to the 2004 report on the global AIDS epidemic.,The NACO figures were collected through HIV sentinel surveillance conducted at 455 sites. According to NACO, there hasn’t been a major upsurge in HIV cases in different risk groups.,As per HIV trends in Tamil Nadu, the percentage of those infected with sexually transmitted HIV decreased from 14.7 per cent to 9.02 per cent while those who contracted it through antenatal means remained stable, coming down by 0.05 per cent. Only intravaneous drug use (IDU) cases showed an increase from 33.8 per cent to 39.11 per cent.,Dr Lakshmi Bhai, Project Director of the Tamil Nadu AIDS Initiative, which is funded by the Bill Gates Foundation, said: ‘‘Tamil Nadu is a big success story in spreading AIDS awareness and implementing prevention programmes.’’,A recent survey showed that 99 per cent of the high-risk groups are aware of the means of contracting HIV and 50 per cent of them possess knowledge of AIDS without any misconception.,This happened due to the political and NGO response to the epidemic, said AIDS Prevention and Control Project Director, Dr P Krishnamurthy. But, gaps, indeed big gaps, continue to exist, said Dr Lakshmi Bhai.,‘‘Tamil Nadu, the only state which conducted a mapping exercise for sex workers, found that only 30 per cent of them had been fully covered by the prevention programmes. Those living in rural areas are yet to be covered. And the STD clinics are still inadequate.’’,Other high prevalence states — Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Manipur and Nagaland — have also shown a downward trend in STD and antenatal clinics.,In Andhra Pradesh, HIV prevalence in antenatal cases has also stabilised while STD clinics recorded a decrease from 30.4 per cent to 21.47 per cent.,Manipur has managed to maintain its downward trend, which began in 2000, in all categories, including IDU. ,Similarily, Nagaland also continued its downward trend in HIV in all categories, except IDU.,‘‘There is serious concern over increases in HIV cases through intravaneous drug use,’’ said Ghosh.,NACO says there’s a rising trend in HIV among drug users in Delhi, Mumbai, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu with the prevalence rising to 0.9 from the previous figure of 0.87 per cent.,But in another good sign, three moderate HIV prevalence states — Gujarat, Goa and Pondicherry — have also stabilised and have not moved into the high prevalence category.

,‘‘Easy access to commercial sex workers and high-risk behaviour makes exposure to HIV and other diseases considerably higher than reported,’’ explains Dr A R Chavan, physician and TB specialist, Nagpada police hospital, Byculla.
,Guarding the rights of the individual, HIV testing will not be mandatory while hiring people or during employment, as per the new policy, which was compiled in co-ordination with the government-run Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS). Besides, if new recruits or employees do want to get themselves tested, the policy ensures complete confidentiality.
,The MDACS framed the policy based on the International Labour Organisation’s code of practice. Dr Anjana Palve, project co-ordinator, says: ‘‘Initially there was reluctance at some stages from the officers. Many had several misconceptions about the disease. So the training sessions were crucial.’’
,                                             As per the policy...                                                                                                                                   , • HIV testing will not be mandatory               while hiring people                • Sensitisation programmes for policemen               and their families                • 83 police stations will begin AIDS-awareness               programmes,‘‘Many of my peers were not aware of the possible threat we are facing from this virus. During the training sessions, perceptions changed considerably,’’ admits Joint Commissioner of Police (administration) Dr Prem Kishan Jain.
,With the guidelines in place and ambitious plans for the future, what remains to be seen is whether the policy translates into action.
,For the moment, a nodal committee will implement and supervise the workplace policy. Members include police surgeon, ACP (welfare), two honorary doctors, two patients living with HIV/AIDS, a woman representative and the MDACS project director.
,Eight-three police stations will begin AIDS-awareness programmes.
,Dr Sanjana Bharadwaj, who has been working in the field for over a decade and is an assistant project director in Unicef (young people and HIV/AIDS), welcomes the policy: ‘‘It’s a step in the right direction. I’m glad the State has taken such a decision, since it would have a lot of implications for every workforce. It’s significant for both the employer and the employee.’’

"Posted:, Aug 21, 2004 at 0134 hrs IST,MUMBAI, AUGUST 20",Indian corporates turn HIV-friendly," HIV stopped being an alien word in the Mumbai corporate world from Thursday. With about 1,500 corporate houses on its rolls, the Bombay Chamber of Commerce and Industry has prepared a non-discriminatory HIV policy for companies. Half of these corporate houses have already adopted the guidelines. 
,Industrial giants such as the Birla group, the Tatas, Hindustan Lever Ltd and banking groups have shown keen interest.  ‘‘It’s a wishlist, but at least there are guidelines we can adopt to battle ignorance, ’’ says Malini Thadani, HSBC senior president, corporate affairs.
,The policy is expected to alleviate the predicament of people like Jayaraj Lokhande. A peon for a telecom firm at Wadala for five years, SSC-pass Lokhande tested positive earlier this month. And the desolate look in his large, brown eyes conveys it all. ‘‘It’s my destiny I suppose,’’ shrugs the 35-year-old. Lokhande is a resident of Sion Koliwada and a father of three. Two months of burning sensation in the palms and feet, and losing 25 kg prompted him to take a test. ‘‘Doctors told me to take a diabetes and HIV test, but main toh hamesha protection use karta tha.’’
,After a week of sick leave, Lokhande worries whether his co-workers would suspect anything. ‘‘At our company, we have paid leave only for tuberculosis.’’ When told about the new policy, he breaks down. ‘‘I hope this new policy helps other workers, at least after I’m gone.’’ ‘‘At least our medical expenses will be taken care of. If they provide job security despite our debilitating conditions, that would be a first,’’ Lokhande says.
,For corporate houses investing in staff welfare, increasing susceptibility of its workforce to the deadly virus is reason enough to translate such a policy-on-paper into action.
,The policy aims to protect all employees against discrimination. While companies such as Siemens India, Tata Steel, the Wockhardt group and GlaxoSmithKline have awareness programmes in place, there is no specific non-discriminatory policy for employees alone.
,The policy was worked out by Avert Society (a joint project of NACO, the Maharashtra government and United States Agency For International Development). (Some names have been changed)
,Your company, HIV and you
,• Employees can say no to tests during recruitment/promotion; it’s not mandatory. Company needs to say why test is required
,• Provisions for health, medical care, disability insurance, workers’ compensation and coverage for dependents
,• A guarantee that no employee would be unfairly treated based on his/her disclosed HIV status
,• Condom-vending machines outside and inside 
,company premises. The proactive role of industries in prevention of HIV can slow down its spread

The study by Dr Saurabh Mehandru and his team was published this week in the Journal of Experimental Medicine, one of the leading scientific journals in the world.  In an interview with The Indian Express, Mehandru, 32, recounted his days in Cambridge School in New Delhi, his being named ‘‘Best Post-Graduate of the Year’’ at medical school in New Delhi, and later being recognised as ‘‘Resident of the Year’’ in Internal Medicine at New York University. He said that the discovery also makes it possible to detect the HIV virus within days of the infection. ‘‘It is now possible for HIV to be discovered within 15-20 days of the infection,’’ said Mehandru, who spent a year researching on the subject.,He adds, however, that the infected person has no apparent signs of the malaise and doctors can detect the infection in the intestines only with a biopsy. A healthy person would not go for such a test, he added. Mehandru’s findings reveal that much before changes become evident in the blood, major immune destruction has already occurred in the intestines. only partially effective in the intestines.

Anand has shot off letters to the Union Health Minister and the chief ministers of all states, recommending a legislation to check discrimination against AIDS-affected children.,The Commission’s move comes in the wake of severe criticism of the Indian Government by a US-based group — Human Rights Watch — for ‘‘ignoring the HIV/AIDS-infected children while formulating policies’’. The group says that the Government has done little to protect children carrying HIV virus and are ‘‘virtually ignoring’’ the affected ones.,Anand has given the following tips to the Govenment: , Sponsor the schooling of infected children, especially girls, Provide right information to schoolchildren about HIV/AIDS, Provide free medical support to AIDS-affected children and ensure that doctors don’t turn them away from hospitals,The Commission has also taken cognizance of the case of two school-going children in Kerala, who were barred from attending classes as they were HIV-positive. A six-year-old girl in Maharastra was also turned away from school on the same pretext, Anand said. His letter added that the discrimination meted out to such children was a matter of ‘‘deep concern’’ to the Commission.

"Posted:, Oct 10, 2004 at 0123 hrs IST,MADURAI, OCTOBER 9",‘HIV widows’ rediscover life ," Till a month ago, 28-year-old A. Rukmani dreaded the idea of a remarriage. It was the ‘‘three knots’’ that gave her ‘‘HIV’’ and left her on the streets as an ‘‘AIDS widow’’. But today, the bright yellow taali is back around her neck, and the mother of a four-year-old girl says she has rediscovered life.,‘‘I have realised that there can be happiness and remarriage after HIV,’’ says Rukmani, sitting in her new one-room house near Theni town, 80 km from here. ‘‘I was cheated by my first husband. I didn’t know he had HIV. Now I know my second husband is HIV-positive, but I am not worried,’’ she adds.,Like Rukmani, who married HIV-positive V. Vijayan, a textile shop owner in Theni, at a public ceremony last month, many more ‘‘HIV widows’’ in rural Tamil Nadu are waiting to walk down the aisle again. As the number of young ‘‘HIV widows’’ swell in the state, in the past few months, at least six HIV-positive couples have tied the knot in Theni and Dindigul districts.,‘‘Most of the HIV-postive women are young widows, in their 20s, with small children. They require moral and emotional support,’’ says Pitchaimani, executive secretary of the Network of Positive Peoples in Theni.,In Theni, a district with high incidence of HIV, there are at least 300 ‘‘HIV widows’’. With no support from their families, most of these young women ‘‘become vulnerable to sexual exploitation’’, and thereby increase the risk of the spread of HIV.,‘‘Bringing together a HIV-positive widow and a HIV-positive man will help check the spread of AIDS, apart from bringing happiness to their lives. And that is why we actively encourage it,’’ says A. Paulraj, president of the Dindigul HIV Positive Society.,Before the wedding, the couple is given a ‘‘list of dos and donts’’. Use condoms and avoid frequent intercourse, preferably once a fortnight, they are told. Also, the support groups for HIV-positive people do not let the couples ‘‘rush into the marriage’’. ‘‘The crucial part is counselling the families of the bride and the groom. For, without a commitment from their families, the girl’s position becomes vulnerable after the man’s death,’’ points out Pitchaimani. So the NGOs ensure that the groom’s family bequeath ‘‘some property to the girl and we encourage them to go public about their HIV status’’.,However, as 40-year-old Paramasivam who married the 28-year-old HIV widow with two children, says: ‘‘It is not an easy task.’’ When he returned to his village, Palasamudiram, after his marriage, he was ostracised by the villagers. ‘‘Things improved’’ only when a police complaint was filed.,Rukmani, too, rues the media glare on her second marriage. Her husband’s family is now refusing to part with his share of the property. But Vijayan says: ‘‘Despite all the problems, I am happy I married an HIV-positive girl. Before I die, I have the opportunity to give happiness to a girl and a child.’’

Hospital, who does not want to be identified, confirmed that post-mortems performed on 25 inmates indicated an alarming rate of HIV infection among inmates.,‘‘The reported deaths could just be the tip of the iceberg,’’ said the doctor. ‘‘A large number of cases are still unreported. We are preparing a report based on recent post-mortems.’’ The report should be ready by next month.,Some of the causes of death listed were tuberculosis, lung infections and liver diseases. Some of the deceased also had a history of drug abuse, reports indicate.,‘‘Though it is not known when and where these inmates contracted this disease, it is well known that many inmates become victims of sodomy inside the jail,’’ an undertrial told Express at the sessions court.,Jail Superintendent Swati Sathe was not available for comment.,The Arthur Road Jail is infamous for its overcrowded conditions. There are more than 3,400 inmates, but its official capacity is just 820. Inmates say they are often forced to sleep on the floor in uncomfortable positions. ‘‘In jail slang the sleeping posture is known as ‘gaadi’ (train),’’ said one inmate.,Most toilets do not have doors and inmates are forced to take showers in groups as water supply is limited.,Assault by jail officials is allegedly common. Lack of proper diet and medical attention by specialists within the jail has added to their woes. The post-mortem results are likely to concern prison authorities, who face a PIL from an NGO called the People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) over the alleged appalling conditions in the jail. The PIL is currently being reviewed by the Bombay High Court.

"Posted:, Jan 24, 2005 at 0046 hrs IST,MEERUT, JANUARY 23",‘8-yr-old gets HIV in transfusion’," What was meant to be a life-saver for a sickly 8-year-old has ended up holding his life to ransom — a blood transfusion at birth, recommended by two renowned city doctors, has left the boy HIV-positive. Both doctors are now absconding.,Police have registered a criminal case against the doctors from Muzaffarnagar — child specialist Dr Girish Kumar and pathologist Dr Veena Agarwal, who owns the blood bank.,Ram Gopal Sharma said his son, a twin, has been treated only by Kumar so far. The twins were born premature in 1996 and had been put in an incubator under Kumar’s care. The two had been falling ill since then and everytime, the Sharmas moved from the village for treatment. It was on one of these trips that Kumar suggested blood transfusion for the boy. Sharma says he specifically recommended Agarwal’s blood blank but neither got the sample tested for HIV.,The boy’s mother, Chandrarekha, says he had not been keeping well over the past few days, developing symptoms of TB too. Last year in July, the child was diagnosed with pneumonia and again blood was got from Dr Aggarwal’s lab. When the child’s condition deteriorated, Dr Kumar expressed his inability to cure him. In December, the boy was referred to Dr Surjit Singh Chadha at Chandigarh PGI’s Immuno-Pathology department. Chadha examined the boy and informed them that the boy was HIV-positive.,‘‘Both parents of the child have tested HIV-negative and the child is also under 15 years. Hence, it can be safely said that circumstantial evidence points to contraction of AIDS through blood transfusion,’’ Chadha said.,Doctors now say the boy may live another 10-15 years. ‘‘Ladka toh haath se nikal gaya...Apni aankhon ke saamne bachchey ka til-til kar marna, sochte huay bhi dar lagta hai (We will have to see him die every moment),’’ says the mother.,Investigations revealed the blood bank’s licence had not been renewed after 2001. District Chief Medical officer Dr B.K. Agarwal said samples have been collected from the bank and a report is awaited. He, however, had no reply as to why no action had been taken against the blood bank so far.,Agarwal’s husband, Dr Aditya Agarwal, however, says the infected blood had not been supplied from her blood bank. The CMO, meanwhile, suggested that the family might have taken treatment from a village quack, something the Sharmas deny.,Muzzafarnagar SSP Deva Sherpa said a case of attempt to commit culpable homicide and negligence has been registered against the two doctors. Preliminary investigations have shown that the name of the donor, whose blood was requested from the lab, is also fake. ‘‘We will ask the court to seize their properties if they evade arrest any longer,’’ SSP Sherpa said, adding that the FIR was registered against them on January 15. Sharma also alleged that Kumar had threatened him against making Chadha’s report public.,Their worry now is further treatment for the boy. Sharma, a factory worker, can barely foot the bills for city hospitals. He says the family has already sold valuables over the past eight years to keep the boy alive. ‘‘What is killing us now is that there is not even a ray of hope,’’ he says.

,But after Monday, Dharasana will also pass down in history as the village where an HIV-positive woman was ostracised, beaten up and murdered—by her own relatives, according to a police complaint.
,Sumitra Patel, 37, was found lying in a pool of blood in a hut on her father’s farm, on the outskirts of Dharasana village. She had been living there for the last 20 days, ever since she was thrown out by relatives, separated from her 13-year-old son.
,Sumitra’s father Hari Patel blames his younger brother Ballu and his son Anil for the murder, saying they had harassed her ‘‘mentally and physically once they found out she was HIV-positive’’.
,Sumitra’s husband died of AIDS in 2003, and she was diagnosed as HIV-positive in August 2004. Soon after that, Sumitra and her son came to stay with Patel, and had been living in the village till her relatives and other villagers found out she was HIV-positive and forced her to move to a hut on the outskirts of Dharasana.
,The Dongri police have registered a complaint under section 302 of the IPC, and detained Ballu and Anil. ‘‘Her assailants had hit Sumitra on the head with a sharp weapon, killing her on the spot,’’ police said.
,‘‘Ballu is my neighbour. Two days ago, Sumitra came to visit us and she also met Anil’s children and interacted with them. When they found out about this, they beat her up and threatened to kill her if she was seen in the village again,’’ a distraught Hari Patel said.
,‘‘Ever since she was told to leave, my daughter had begun living at my farm. I used to visit her daily to give her food. On Monday morning, I was informed that my daughter had been murdered. I rushed to the farm to see my child in a pool of blood. My brother and his son killed her. They feared she would pass on AIDS to their children,’’ he added.
,Police officers said they suspect the relatives. ‘‘Ballu and Anil have admitted to having threatened her with death if she entered the village again,’’ said an official.
,Villagers like Batuk Patel admit they were afraid of Sumitra but didn’t want her killed. ‘‘We were happy when she left but did not expect anyone to kill her,’’ Batuk said.

While the extent of the spread of the disease is unknown, officials called a news conference to say the situation was alarming.,“We consider this a major potential problem,” said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, commissioner of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. The department issued an alert to all hospitals and doctors in the city.,The virus was found in a New York City man in his mid-40s who engaged in unprotected anal sex with other men on multiple occasions while he was using crystal methamphetamine, a stimulating drug.,Some AIDS specialists around the country expressed scepticism about the alarm, believing that it might be an isolated case. But Dr Frieden said the case was a “wake-up call”.,“What’s unique about this is the combination of multiple drug resistance and a rapid course,” said Dr Ronald O. Valdiserri, Centers for Disease Control.,Dr David Ho, who did the testing that identified the strain, described the convergence of the two problems as “a scary phenomenon”.,The primary investigation in this case shows that the patient could have developed AIDS in as quickly as two months. On an average, it takes 10 years from the time a person is first infected with HIV to the development of AIDS. 	—NYT

He will also be asked to draw pictures of his family members and write an essay,’’ a senior official said.,Arrested in May last year for allegedly injecting his wife Bharti, five months pregnant, with a contaminated syringe, Sharma is presently in judicial remand.,The forensic laboratory had sought all case papers, including the medical report of the accused’s wife and his baby, 11-month-old Vaishnavi, who has also tested HIV-positive following his wife’s allegations.,‘‘The test will not only help us get more details but will also help us probe whether it was an accident or executed with malafide intention,’’ said the official.,Sharma married Bharti on December 13, 2001. Differences arose after Bharti came to know of her husband’s love affair and the situation reportedly worsened when Bharti gave birth to a baby girl. She was forced to return to her parent’s home where she fell ill. It was on January 9, 2004, that she tested HIV-positive during a blood test.,Bharati lodged a criminal complaint against her husband and in-laws with the Nandurbar police on March 30, 2004.

Surve, admitted on April 18, jumped off the fifth-floor window and fractured his limbs. He died an hour later.,‘‘He had reached an advanced stage of HIV and was probably influenced by Ravi Patil’s suicide,’’ said Dr Pravin Shingare, dean of JJ Hospital. Patil, who killed himself on April 19, and Surve were in the same ward.,In a city that has around four lakh HIV patients — Maharashtra has an estimated seven lakh — many, like Jayaraman, find it difficult to come to terms with their illness. Suicide, then, becomes an escape route.,‘‘People with chronic ailments like HIV/AIDS have greater chances of committing suicide probably because of the high rate of depression,’’ explained Dr Anjali Chhabria, a consulting psychiatrist.,‘‘In 20 years, I’ve seen families battle this illness,’’ said Dr Alka Deshpande, unit in-charge of the NACO-sponsored anti-retroviral therapy at JJ Hospital. ‘‘But counselling is important to dismiss doubts.’’,Dr M.E.

,But what made this match different were the ads—they clearly mentioned that both were HIV carriers.
,Breaking all mental barriers, an increasing number of HIV-positive men and women in Gujarat are coming out in the open on their health status to find the right partner—not just in newspapers but also on websites.
,‘‘I was having a hard time taking care of my five-year-old daughter after I lost my first husband due to AIDS three years ago,’’ says Sushma, who works as a pre-primary school teacher.
,‘‘We are being truthful. We only marry people of the same status. By seeing the ads, we have better chances of finding a better match,’’ says Nayan, an auto mechanic.
,Says Hitesh, a 32-year-old autorickshaw driver, who recently decided to place a matrimonial ad in a newspaper: ‘‘I have been a carrier for almost three years now. Earlier I was disappointed, but now I am keen on getting married and living a normal life.’’
,Says Dr D M Saxena, Additional Project Director of Gujarat State AIDS Control Society: ‘‘It’s a welcome change which has come in the last few years. Gradually, people have understood the difference between a carrier and a full-blown patient and HIV-positive people are accepted in a much better way.’’
,Others, like this 29-year-old woman from a upper middle class household, don’t mind advertising their HIV status but refrain from revealing their identity till the very end.
,‘‘Being HIV-positive is not as much a taboo as it was earlier. But for safety reasons, we do not directly give away our names or addresses but put the contact numbers of some close relative,’’ she said, when contacted through a number given in a matrimonial ad on a website. Says H Raj, who runs Face to Face, a matrimonial service in the city’s Navrangpura area: ‘‘People are definitely more open and bolder now. I came across three HIV carriers recently—from Ahmedabad, Vadodara and Surat—who readily agreed to place ads in local dailies and did not think twice about mentioning their health status.’’
,One of the three, Raj says, is happily married today.
,Over 5,400 AIDS cases have been recorded in Gujarat since the first one in 1986—an estimated 0.3 per cent of the 2.5 crore adults in the state are HIV-positive.
,While Gujarat was marked for middle-level prevalence in 1994, along with Tamil Nadu and Nagaland, it has been able to keep a check on its AIDS numbers, say officials.
,Says Dr Laxman Malodia, of the AIDS Control Society of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC): ‘‘It was not easy but it was never as difficult as in other states.

Sarabha Nagar police have booked Dr Harpreet Kaur Bhullar running Bhullar Nursing Home at Sarabha Nagar for transfusing HIV positive blood to a four months pregnant woman in November 2003.,The boy to whom the woman gave birth is one year old now. He too is HIV positive. Sarabha Nagar police have registered a First Information Report (FIR) against Dr Bhullar for committing a negligent act that is likely to spread infection and for endangering the life of others. The accused has not been arrested yet, and the police is conducting raids to find her.,The victim’s husband Surinder Singh, in his complaint to the Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Ludhiana alleged that his 32-year-old pregnant wife was under going treatment at Bhullar Nursing Home. When she went to the nursing home in November 2003, her fourth month of pregnancy, Dr Harpreet Kaur advised her blood transfusion of four units, as the woman was anemic.,Surinder Singh said that following this, he arranged for four units of blood which was collected from four donors. ‘‘Immediately after she was given blood, my wife suffered from jaundice but in due course of time she became all right,’’ he added.,The complainant alleged that the four units of blood were given to his wife without conducting prior tests for various infections and diseases. In the ninth month of her pregnancy when she went to Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, she was found to be HIV positive. ,Surinder alleged that when he checked the blood samples of four people who had donated blood, it was found that one of the donors, a truck cleaner was HIV positive.,He alleged that his wife had contracted infection from this person, which obviously was not checked before transfusing blood to her.,Following the complaint, SSP Ludhiana Narinder Pal Singh asked the Ludhiana chapter of Indian Medical Association (IMA) to conduct an enquiry into the case. A committee comprising of founder vice-chancellor of Baba Farid University of Health Sciences Dr Livtar Singh Chawla, head of CMCH Pathology Department Dr Nalini Calton and chairman of the PNDT Advisory Committee Dr Kumkum Awasthy looked into the matter.

They understand the implications but do not mind,” said this 31-year-old, whose wife died of AIDS. He has two children.,One of the women who responded to his ad is an architect from Surat. A divorcee and HIV negative, she said, “There is more to marriage than having children. There are other factors like affection and support and if he is a good human being, why not?’’,However, in most cases, the women are widows or in need of financial security. A 40-year-old HIV positive man from the Bapunagar in Ahmedabad said, “Two of the responses I got were from a 19-year-old girl in my area whose father did not have money for her dowry while another was a 23-year-old widow with a seven-month-baby whose husband had died in a road accident,” said this auto-rickshaw driver. “I didn’t have children, so I married the widow,’’ he said.,His wife said she wanted security. ‘‘I could not have looked after my daughter. I don’t repent the decision as he takes good care of us,’’ she says.,A leading sociologist of the city, Gaurang Jani, who also runs a programme for AIDS patients, narrated the example of a well-to-do HIV-positive senior citizen who married a young middle-class woman who is not a carrier. “He did it for companionship,” Jani said.,‘‘Many woman might be looking for financial security. However, the fact is that cases of HIV-negative women marrying HIV-positive men are on the rise,’’ said Jani, adding that one of the reasons behind such a trend is the increasing awareness of the difference between an AIDS patient and a carrier.,The trend, he said, also reflected male dominance. ‘‘Men who are financial well-off manage to find such women. The reverse trend has not been noted,” he added.

"Posted:, Jun 18, 2005 at 0232 hrs IST,DINDIGUL (TAMIL NADU), JUNE 17","Tamil Nadu school slams doors on HIV positive orphans, says it’s risky"," A school in Dindigul, Tamil Nadu, has refused admission to four HIV positive children, aged between five and 15 years. According to the head of Gandhiji Memorial Middle School, S Padmanabhan, the children would ‘‘fall or bump against other kids in the school bus and pass their infection to them.’’
,‘‘I am sure if the parents come to know that HIV positive children are travelling with their wards in the school bus, they will object,’’ Padmanabhan told this reporter. ‘‘I do not want to risk parents pulling  their children out of my school. I will deal with the admission of these children later.’’
,Ironically, according to local residents, Padmanabhan has helped in organising AIDS awareness programmes for Rotary Club. He has been running the school in the town for several years.
,The four boys — Manikandan (8), Savadamuthu (10), Mohan (5) and Pugazhendi (4) — are among 15 HIV orphans who live at ‘Anbagam’, a special home set up for them. ‘‘With schools located at least 2-3 km away, it seemed sensible to put them in a school which had a bus facility,’’ pointed out A C Thangachan, president of the Dindigul District HIV Positive Society, who started ‘Anbagam’, moved by the plight of the orphans who were turned away by other homes. ‘Anbagam’ is housed in a small one-storeyed building in David Nagar colony, about 3 km outside the town.
,Walking even a kilometre was a difficult task for the HIV positive children. When Thangachan pleaded with Gandhiji Memorial School’s Padmanabhan, he was firm. Even if the children were admitted, he won’t allow them to use the school bus, he said, asking him to make his own arrangements. Thangachan was finally forced to put two of the boys in another school two kilometres away. ‘‘Now I take them on my motorbike,’’ he said.
,With the news of what happened at the school spreading in David Nagar Colony, with its 30-odd hutments, the ‘Anbagam’ inmates are likely to be thrown out of their home. ‘‘Now the colony residents want us to leave,’’ says Thangachan. ‘‘When a school head himself adopts such a stance, residents feel there must be some danger in exposing themselves to the kids.’’
,Dindigul town, about 400 km from Chennai, is a hotbed of HIV (Tamil Nadu is considered the highest AIDS prevalence-state in the country). AIDS workers claim that Dindigul district alone has nearly 20,000 infected people. But what is worrying NGOs is the increasing number of infected children being orphaned by couples dying of the disease. What’s worse is that they are becoming victims of discrimination.
,‘‘Discrimination is a major challenge in the fight against AIDS. HIV positive patients are already depressed and demoralised. But an insensitive society and system can kill them sooner,’’ said A. Raja Rathinam, a medical field worker of Dindigul AIDS Society.

"Posted:, Jul 12, 2005 at 0141 hrs IST,DALIAN, JULY 11",China tests new HIV medication," A Chinese company has started clinical trials of a new HIV/AIDS medication which it claims can prevent the deadly HIV virus from entering immune cells.,After four-years of research, Dr. Zhou Genfa, chairman of the Tianjin-based Fusogen Pharmaceuticals, says they have developed a vaccine which functions as an HIV fusion inhibitor.,‘‘Normally, the HIV virus invades the human body by fusing with the cell’s membrane,’’ said Gao Fu, Microbiology Research Institute chief of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, speaking yesterday at a meeting on new HIV/AIDS medication in Beijing.,‘‘So the key is to safeguard the ‘gate’ and prevent the occurrence of membrane fusion,’’ he was quoted as saying by China Daily.,The medication can target the HIV membrane fusion protein and prevent the virus from attacking cells. AIDS patients and those who are HIV positive will need to be injected everyday, Zhou said.,Zhou said he had been inspired by T20, the first drug in a new class of fusion inhibitors developed by an American company which was granted marketing approval by the US Food and Drug Administration in March 2003.,But, the Chinese medication, which has been registered as a new medicine with the state food and drug administration, employs a totally different molecular modelling. ,And its price will be ‘‘significantly’’ lower than T20 which can cost $20,000 per patient per year, he said. The new medication is likely to hit the market at the end of next year, the report said.

"Posted:, Jun 27, 2005 at 0000 hrs IST","On HIV, a few positive notes"," Celina is petite, middle aged and has amazing confidence for someone who is HIV positive. She has been living with HIV for the last 12 years and is now one of the articulate public faces of people living with HIV/AIDS. Only 10 per cent of those who are HIV positive even know they are infected. The knowledge that they are infected affects them deeply. “Many of us are shattered when the doctor reveals our status,” says Celina. “So an insensitive media carrying our photographs as though it is a great scoop can ruin our lives. In fact the impression I got from the media reports was that I was dying because I was HIV positive.”,Celina was still coping with the death of her husband in Goa when the media carried her picture and story. Her in-laws immediately threw her out. The excuses given ranged from “your brother-in-law will not be able to get married if you are in this house” to “mosquito bites and shared toilets will lead to others in the family contracting the virus”.,I wish the media had said something about where she could go for legal and medical assistance. When Celina was thrown out by her family she did not know she had a right to live in her house or that she had the right to confidentiality. The right to information on HIV/AIDS should extend not just to the infected but to the public at large and in particular the media. The public impression is that you will not contract the infection if you are living with a goodlooking person or a well-known person. It is seen as a problem of the poor, the not so well dressed. The media are more curious about where and how you got the infection than about how you are living with it.,Why are media stories so negative? HIV positive people jumping off hospital buildings; widows of AIDS-affected being thrown out of their homes and villages. Important as these stories are in terms of news value, is there a fear that if you present a rosy picture of those living positive lives, the “preventive” efforts by government and NGOs may be reduced? Is there a fear that funding for HIV/AIDS will drop?,Even doctors are still ignorant about HIV/AIDS, says Celina. Most positive people are told by ill-informed doctors that their days are numbered if they are not on drugs. In fact, Celina says you can live for 15 years without drugs. “I stand before you as proof of my statement. By access to clean air and nutritious food, positive people can live long, healthy lives.” To Celina’s recipe for normal, healthy lives, Doe Nair, who runs a care and support home for positive people, has added another equally important ingredient: happiness. “Keep them happy and they will live longer,” she says. It is only when the immune system is down that you need the support of drugs.

The tentative approval means the drug meets FDA norms for efficacy, safety and quality, and can be part of the US President’s ‘PEPFAR’ program to supply low-cost AIDS drugs to the poorest and developing countries.,Tentative clearance also means that the existing patents and exclusivity rights will not allow the firms to market their drug in the US, though it meets all regulatory approvals. They can market these drugs elsewhere. ,‘‘These are the first generic versions of Viramune tablets manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim. These products will now be available for consideration for purchase under the President’s Emergency Plan For Aids Relief (PEPFAR),’’ an FDA release said on Tuesday.

"Posted:, Aug 13, 2005 at 0205 hrs IST,SRINAGAR, AUGUST 12",HIV in jawans rings J-K alarm," Alarmed by the spurt in detection of AIDS among paramilitary forces in the Valley, the J&K government has written to the security agencies expressing concern.,In the past six months, 15 persons tested HIV-positive during routine tests at the Sher-e-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS) and the SMHS Hospital in Srinagar. Nine of them were from the Border Security Force (BSF) and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF).,The nine jawans who tested positive were posted in Srinagar, Budgam, Baramulla and Pulwama. ‘‘They had come for routine check-ups, complaining about fever, weight loss, tuberculosis, chronic diarrhoea and throat infection,’’ a senior doctor said.,A 36-year-old BSF jawan posted at Pulwama recently died of AIDS at SKIMS Hospital. A source said he had come for a routine check-up after a substantial weight loss. ‘‘He died within a week,’’ said the source.,‘‘We are aware of such cases. We have conducted a survey and we are deeply concerned,’’ said Minister of State for Health and Medical Education Abdul Gaffar Sofi. ‘‘We have already written to the security agencies and have asked them to be careful.’’,The government has also asked the security agencies to step up the AIDS awareness campaign among their personnel, he said.,What such campaigns and regular screening can do can be seen in the manner in which the Army has dealt with the threat—the HIV virus has infected around 90 Armymen in the past four years. He Army set up an in-house state-of-the-art screening centre and started an awareness campaign at its 92 base hospital at 15 Corps headquarters here.,There were around 45 HIV- positive soldiers in 2001. ‘‘But after we launched a multi-pronged campaign, there has been a gradual decline,’’ said Brigadier K K Duttagupta, Commandant 92 base hospital. In 2002, the number of soldiers contracting HIV came down to 20, and in the subsequent years, the figures were 12 and 10. In the first seven months of this year, only five cases were detected, said Brig Duttagupta. He said their centre had screened 700 jawans for HIV last year.,In 2000, the J&K government had launched two voluntary counselling and testing centres in Srinagar. Since then, 41 jawans, most of them from the BSF, have tested HIV-positive.,Deputy Inspector General, BSF, K Srinivasan said: ‘‘We have now introduced half-yearly health check-ups. We are holding meetings for our doctors to talk to the jawans.’’,Inspector General, CRPF, Ranjeet Sinha, said “some cases have been found but it’s not alarming.’’,Besides medical counselling and screening, the Army has roped in priests in its units. ‘‘We have around 1,000 priests trained at Pune for this purpose,’’ Brig Duttagupta said.

"Posted:, Aug 24, 2005 at 0319 hrs IST,IMPHAL, AUGUST 23",HIV: His Individual Victory," In 1989, when K Basantakumar met a group of people in secret—all former Intravenous Drug Users (IDUs)—to share experiences and keep each other out of trouble, he had already been jailed seven times for possession and peddling, lived on the streets, been in and out of rehab, left by his wife and children and plagued by ill-health.
,Those were the days when the spread of HIV/AIDS among IDUs zoomed from 0 to 60 per cent in Manipur and drug users were routinely ostracized and arrested.
,Basantakumar’s clandestine meetings in Manipur’s busy Thangal Bazaar were probably the start of a unique self-help movement that’s now almost a way of life in the state.
,Today, Imphal has over 50 Self-Help Groups (SHGs) for the youth. Several organisations, including the Care Foundation and the Manipur Network of Positive People, are battling Manipur’s biggest twin threat—drugs and HIV/AIDS.
,In 1991, after meeting for a couple of years and staying clean, Basantakumar co-founded the Social Awareness Service Organisation (SASO)—an NGO that tried a different approach to drug abuse and the resultant spread of HIV/AIDS due to the sharing of needles and syringes.
,SASO provided drug users with clean-use techniques, by making available syringes for individual use, counselling and medication in an effort to curtail the spread of HIV/AIDS among this user community in the state.
,The 48-year-old continues this work as project coordinator with North-East India Harm Reduction Network, and is an inspiration to thousands of youngsters who are IDUs and HIV positive.

This incident sparked off a huge public outcry. Family members would often get drug users arrested, the police and society cracked down heavily,’’ recalls Basantakumar.
, ‘‘Instead of solving the problem, this drove them underground. Drug abuse continued, but in secret and through sharing limited syringes, leading to a wider spread of HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis-C,’’ he adds. 
,But the grassroots movement changed everything. Now, drug users can visit drop-in centres at any NGO and get new syringes, pick up  vials of distilled water, get free tea, watch TV or play carrom.

"Posted:, Aug 29, 2005 at 0150 hrs IST,CHENNAI, AUGUST 28",They all line up to adopt HIV kids," Two-and-a-half year-old Shubha is the darling of the Thiruvalluvar Nagar slum colony in Broadway in congested North Chennai. The pretty, chubby child plays on the cobbled pathway as passing neighbours pick her up for a hug or a peck on the cheek.
,Shubha is HIV positive and 31-yr-old Soorya’s third child. Or at least, that’s what Soorya proudly tells everyone.
,In fact, Soorya had actually badgered an orphanage to let her adopt the child, knowing fully well her HIV positive status. This, despite having two sons—Surender and Narender—of her own and barely being able to make ends meet. She works in a butcher’s shop and her husband, Gajendran, is a ‘‘load man’’ for a transport company.
,When Soorya had brought Shubha to her colony, she was a scrawny nine-month-old. She had been picked from the streets by the Chennai-based non-government organisation—Community Health Education Society (CHES)—which provides care for orphaned HIV positive children.
,                                             Chennai slum shows the               way                                                                                                                    , • Soorya, who has two sons and has               trouble making ends meet, has adopted HIV-positive Shubha               • Soorya saw Shubha at an NGO orphanage               • Today everyone dotes on the child               • Subhas example has inspired               29 women in her colony who want to adopt HIV-positive children,She was visiting the Home as part of a AIDS awareness drill she went through as the leader of the Self-Help Group in her slum colony. ‘‘Shubha kept looking at us with her large eyes. They were so full of yearning for love and affection. I was extremely touched,’’ said Soorya.
,While there were no laws or rules governing adoption of HIV-positive children, that too by families in the lowest economic bracket, CHES director, Dr P Manorama, was ready to take on the challenge after she received the government’s informal nod.
,Shubha had already tested positive for HIV in the preliminary tests. The final test when she was 18 months old, came positive as well. But Soorya was adamant. She wanted to take the child home immediately and was not too keen on any more HIV tests.
,But there were some procedures to be completed.
,The CHES authorities had to be convinced that Shubha could lead a normal life with Soorya and her family. The organisation also had to ensure that the couple shared a comfortable relationship and looked after their own children well.
,Only after the CHES was convinced, did it start the laborious paperwork. ‘‘I was impressed by her stubbornness and unswerving conviction. They would wait patiently for hours outside my office for the formalities to be completed. It took eight months,’’ said Dr Manorama.
,That the experiment paid off is plain.
,These days, Shubha wears a well-groomed, healthy look. Soorya dotes on her, and Gajendran picks her up the first thing after he gets back from work. Her little brothers, aged 8 and 10, adore her. Soorya’s relatives and the neighbours have enthusiastically embraced the new member into their fold.
,Inspired by Soorya’s example, another woman in the same slum, Motcha Mary (38), also wanted to foster a child, Nithya, from the same CHES Home, which had 30 infected children, including six toddlers.
,Now, twenty-two more women of the same colony are eagerly waiting in the queue. In a country of 1.4 million HIV-positive children, the gestures of Soorya and Motcha Mary are rare.

"Posted:, Aug 17, 2005 at 0000 hrs IST",The business of fighting HIV/AIDS," The involvement of civil society in combating HIV/AIDS in India is crucial to its success. While almost 1,000 NGOs are working with the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) to control the disease, the involvement of business is less well-known and just as critical.,There are good reasons for corporates to be involved in restraining spread of the disease. ADB estimates that the loss due to HIV/AIDS in 2001 was $7 billion, and could touch $17 billion by 2010 if current trends continue. At the macro-level, greater exposure to the virus influences economic growth, global competitiveness, workforce demographics and consumer base, as has been witnessed in high-prevalence countries. It may even prove to be a factor in investment decisions of overseas companies. At the firm-level, the environment in which businesses operate, produce and market is distorted. Productivity losses may be reflected through higher absenteeism, greater turnover, and increased healthcare costs. Training and recruitment costs go up, and staff morale suffers.,In India, the number of people with the virus is 5.134 million according to the NACO estimate of 2005. Nearly 90 per cent of cases are in the 15-49 year age-group, which translates into 1 of every 100 workers of this group being affected. Six states — Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Manipur and Nagaland — are high-prevalence states where incidence in the high-risk group is over 5 per cent. The first four of these are also among India’s fastest growing states. Other states, such as UP and Bihar with large migrant populations, are highly vulnerable as well.,The corporate sector is particularly well-positioned to control spread of HIV/AIDS. It has access to a large population of workers, as well as to their families and the wider community. Moreover, corporate management skills, including capacity building and information-dissemination, make them an effective and efficient partner in the struggle. Advocacy and awareness building are two crucial components for prevention of the disease. Corporates with their particular talents and access can therefore be critical partners in prevention campaigns.,The WEF Global Business Survey on Business and HIV/,AIDS covered 8,700 business executives in 104 countries in the early half of 2004 for tracking business response. It found that 71 per cent of the companies did not have policies to address the disease; 66 per cent could provide no estimates of HIV-positive employees on their payroll. On the other hand, in the hardest hit countries, the proportion of firms with policies for HIV/AIDS increased to 47 per cent.,Indian industry has not lagged behind in efforts to combat the virus. Companies in sectors that are particularly vulnerable are attuned to its potential dangers. Tata Steel has a large HIV/AIDS prevention and control programme and regularly conducts awareness programmes. Ashok Leyland has reached out to 90,000 truckers during its training programme in Tamil Nadu. Bajaj Auto organises programmes for awareness generation and provides facilities for testing and counseling to affected persons as well as reimbursement of most of the treatment expenditure. Modicare works with the government, schools and hospitals for information, education and treatment. The role of an industry organisation is considered vital for standardising guidelines, for persuasion and assistance, for supplying a database of best practices, for providing support to smaller companies and for gathering industry-wide information. An industry organisation also helps in consolidating business response and forming effective partnerships with other organisations.,There is much that individual firms, large and small, can do to play their role in awareness generation and advocacy. Companies must develop programmes for tackling HIV/AIDS for welfare of employees as well as corporate reputation. They may conduct sensitisation sessions for all levels of staff, put up posters and distribute leaflets for information and education, and establish contacts with local clinics for health care and insurance cover. Publicised policies against discrimination should be instituted and voluntary testing encouraged with no fear of consequences. Free condoms could be distributed, and counseling centers set up. Larger companies could also engage with surrounding communities and extend their services to NGOs and volunteers.,Private sector participation and public-private partnerships can together supply effective and sustained efforts to combat the HIV scourge, enabling infected people to lead a productive life and preventing the spread of the disease to the population at large.

This makes zinc supplements a safe and effective way of increasing the lifespan of such children.,The study is important as very few interventions are available to reduce early death among children suffering from AIDS. It has more significance in a country like India where, according to NACO, children comprise about 5 percent of the total estimated 5.13 million HIV cases. According to the study, zinc cuts the chance of diarrhoea and pneumonia without risking worsening of HIV infection. Diarrhoea is one of the leading causes of death among children with HIV/AIDS as the compromised immunity make them vulnerable to stomach infections.,The study led by Dr William Moss involved 96 children, aged between 6 months and five years, from Grey’s Hospital in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.

They said they were innocent and their confessions extracted under torture. ,The six had been sentenced to death by firing squad after a conviction, which was condemned internationally and had undermined Libya's attempts to reverse three decades of treatment as a rogue state by the West.,“The five nurses and the Palestinian doctor will not be considered as prisoners condemned to death after today's ruling. They will become only defendants waiting for retrial,” said a court official, who did not want to be named, ,The Supreme Court accepted appeals against a lower court ruling both on substance and procedure, their lawyers said. Its decision followed an agreement last week between Libya and Bulgaria to set up a fund to help families of the sick children. AIDS experts have said the outbreak had started before the nurses arrived and was probably caused by poor hygiene.

,
In what experts call the ""best news on AIDS for India,"" an Indo-Canadian team of scientists has come up with the first definitive evidence that the AIDS epidemic is slowing down in at least southern India, considered the the cradle of the disease in the country. This essentially means that the prevention program seems to be making headway and gloom-and-doom scenarios of AIDS in India need to be put into perspective.,The study, in the latest issue of the British medical journal The Lancet, reports a one-third decline in new HIV infections in the worst-hit regions of India: Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.,While data from north India is still cause for worry, the Lancet study reports that prevalence of HIV-1 (the most common variant of the virus in India) prevalence fell in the southern states from 1.7% to 1.1%—a relative reduction of 35%.,UNAIDS, World Health Organisation and the Government of India all agree on an estimated 5.1 million people infected with HIV, 75% of them in the southern states.,study's 10-member team of researchers studied a sample of over 2.9 lakh women and 58,000 men attending 132 sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics in the north and south from 2000 to 2004.,""This is the best news so far on AIDS in India,"" Nirmal Kumar Ganguly, director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research, told ,tonight, adding that intervention strategies based on increasing awareness and imparting adequate information especially among high-risk groups might have helped put a brake on the epidemic.,Corollary: an even bigger effort is needed in the rest of India especially in currently low-prevalence states if the war on AIDS has to be won, said Ganguly.,The Lancet study tracked HIV prevalence among young women between 15-24 years of age attending pregnancy or antenatal clinics in India's southern and northern states. Researchers used HIV trends among young women attending antenatal clinics as an indicator to monitor trends in new infections among the general population.,In India, the male use of female sex workers is the main reason for the spread, which subsequently puts wives in a vulnerable position. According to the research group, in recent years, the Indian government, the World Bank and other agencies have aimed intervention and awareness programmes aimed at sex workers and their efforts appear to have contributed ""to a drastic decline."",""There have been many predictions, mostly based on guesswork, that India's AIDS problem will explode—as it did in southern Africa—but we now have direct evidence of something positive,"" says the study's co-author, Prabhat Jha, of the Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Toronto, Canada, formerly with the World Bank in New Delhi.,""The good news is that HIV in young adults appears to be declining in the south—most likely or perhaps only due to men keeping away from red light area or using condoms more often when they do. The not-so-good news is that trends in the north remain uncertain and poorly studied."",Most of the data emerged from portals of the National AIDS Control Organization, New Delhi. Reinforcing this positive trend, says the lead author of the study, Rajesh Kumar, of the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research in Chandigarh, is the fact that the decline among young women in the south are broad-based: ""among urban and rural women and among educated or illiterate women."",Kumar cautions that while the findings are good news, the battle is far from over. ""HIV remains a huge problem in India and we have to remain vigilant,"" he said. ""We're not saying the epidemic is under control yet—we are saying that prevention efforts with high-risk groups thus far seem to be having an effect."",Ashok Alexander, director of Avahan, the AIDS prevention initiative of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, also urges caution: ""Prevention works but we have not achieved scaled prevention yet in India."",He suggests that Jha's data shows that the epidemic is not under control in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka while there is a more positive trend in Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu where there has been the longest record of prevention.,Alexander, who looks after the $200-million AIDS initiative of the Gates Foundation feels that data is misleading as an indicator of epidemic trends in India adding that ""we need data from high-risk groups that is highly missing.""

According to the latest National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) figures, the country has reported 72,000 new infections last year compared to 28,000 in 2004.,The new figures (that will be released in a week) take the total HIV estimate in the country to over 5.2 million.,Out of the infected 60.3 per cent are male, 38.4 per cent female and 0.96 per cent children. According to NACO, a majority of the infections are in the 22-45 age group.,The HIV prevalence percentage in the country is 0.88 and remains below the epidemic status of ,1 per cent.,While an international study last week suggested that the growth rate of HIV/AIDS in the general population in high-prevalence Southern states has gone down, the high-risk groups in these states seem to be adding to the numbers.,While Andhra Pradesh still leads the table with 2 per cent prevalence in general population, the figure has dipped from 2.25 in 2004.,Nagaland is second with 1.63 per cent prevalence, an increase from 1.43 in 2004. Karnataka (1.25), Maharashtra (1.25), Manipur (1.25) and Goa (1.13) have crossed the one-per cent epidemic mark. Manipur, however, has shown a decrease—from 1.50 per cent in 2004 to 1.25.,The problem, however, seems to be the high-risk groups attending the STD clinics. In Andhra, the figure is up from 16.40 per cent in 2004 to 22.80 per cent in 2005 (see box).,Other highlights of the report., NACO has marked Mizoram (0.88 per cent), Delhi (0.25), Rajasthan (0.13), Orissa (0.25) and West Bengal (0.66), as the slow and silent pockets of the epidemic and the states to watch out for., The other areas of concern are states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar where lack of data poses a problem—both states have shown zero per cent prevalence this year. Zero prevalence has been reported from 11 states this year. NACO, however, has decided to replace zero prevalence with 0.17 in these states.,,,	2004	2005,Andhra Pradesh	16.40	22.80,Karnataka	12.00	13.60,Maharashtra	10.80	15.20,Manipur	7.20	12.20,Nagaland	1.72	3.48,Rajasthan	1.26	4.04,Orissa	2.80	4.60,Mizoram	1.00	3.00,West Bengal	0.88	2.04,Tripura	0.73	1.26,(,)

,

,

,


,
From his two-room dispensary in nearby Kaalappanayakanpatty village 'Dr' S Matheswaran claims he can cure AIDS and a host of other diseases with his brand of 'Indian medicine'. He even offers a five-month 'AIDS package' for just Rs 12,000. 
,Matheswaran's diagnostic techniques are unique too. The doctor directs desperate, gullible villagers to Mikro Clinical Lab in Rasipuram for tests. If the lab tests show the patients with 'seven HIV counts,' he leaves it to God, after his treatment, of course. But anything below, he claims his medicines — powdered herbs and lehyams (syrupy mixtures) — work wonders. 
,After the treatment, he sends his patients back to the lab, which declares they have been cured. In many cases, the patients are sent back for another round of treatment for the same amount. 
,Thankfully, he doesn't recommend donkey's milk, which is popular with other 'doctors' like him in the region. He says it is just a myth that donkey's milk — one ounce costs Rs 10 — cures HIV. His medicines are a sure bet, he assures.
,Quacks are as common as STD booths in this district, where every second person is a truck driver, cleaner or helper, constituting one of the highest HIV risk groups. Namakkal district, which was earmarked as an 'epicentre' of virus prevalence in the country a few years ago, has a high number of HIV-related deaths. While official figures put the number of HIV+ cases in the district at one lakh, NGOs say the figure could be more than double.
,''Villagers have spent lakhs of rupees on quacks, selling their small land holdings and borrowing heavily,'' says P Williams, finance officer of the HIV Ullor Nala Sangam (HUNS), working hard to rid the myth that HIV can be 'cured'. Sivagami of Alangattuputhur spent Rs 45,000 on a quack in Moganoor village. 
,''The old man who ran the clinic gave me a gooey brown stuff, which we believe was mostly palm sugar. I was asked to have it with black tea twice a day,'' says Sivagami, who now works for HUNS, creating awareness about quacks in her village. She adds the 1,200 members of the organisation had been duped by quacks.
,But for politicians in the six constituencies of the district, famous for its poultry and transport industries, the focus is water supply, infrastructure and cold storage facilities for poultry farmers. The worrying AIDS scenario, or the thriving business of quackery, has never figured in their scheme of things.
,Buthis time, perhaps realising that HIV patients and their families constituted a sizeable chunk of the 12.5 lakh voters in the district, S Gandhiselvan, a candidate from Tiruchengode, quietly reached out to intervention workers of NGOs in his constituency, promising them financial assistance if he became a MLA. 
,At a meeting of workers in Kabilar Malai, PMK candidate Dr Nedunchezhian promised help in routing government funds to the district for tackling AIDS. 
,But both chose to overlook the quacks, many of whom are believed to have political patronage. No case has been registered against a single quack so far. 
,One of the biggest in the business is Rajah Clinic run by the kin of one N A Rangasamy, who shot himself three years ago apparently fearing an I-T raid at his palatial house-cum-clinic in Thokawad in Tiruchengode. Finance Minister and MLA C Ponnaiyan, denied a ticket this time, is said to have inaugurated the clinic, which claims ''to cure HIV/AIDS''.

,

,

,
,


,
HIV infection can be transmitted from an infected woman to her newborn baby. But this transmission can be prevented by a few simple measures. Dr Bir Singh, MD, AIIMS, explains how:,,, The mother to child transmission of HIV is referred to as ""vertical transmission"" and can occur during pregnancy, childbirth and through breast feeding., The risk of such a transmission in developing countries is reported to be  between 30-50 per cent if the baby is breastfed for 18 months. The risk at other times is less—5-10 per cent during pregnancy and 10-15 per cent during delivery.,,, A few simple measures can prevent transmission of HIV infection. These interventions are available at many government health facilities through the ""Prevention of parent to child transmission of HIV Programme"" being implemented by the NACO., In this programme, a pregnant women is offered an HIV test in an anti-natal clinic. If the test turns out positive, she is requested to come back for an institutional delivery. During delivery, she is administered a single tablet of an anti-retroviral drug Nevirapine., The newborn is also administered one dose of Nevirapine within 72 hours of birth. It is also ensured that interventions like episiotomy (widening of vaginal opening to facilitate delivery) and artificial rupture of membranes are avoided., The mother is also counselled on infant feeding options. If she can afford it, the baby is put on replacement feeds (other milks). Otherwise, breast feeding is continued for first six months, after which the baby is weaned and put on semi-solid feed.,,, Nevirapine is a safe and effective drug and reduces the risk of HIV transmission by about 50 per cent. Recently, however, there have been concerns about the development of resistance to it., As a result, NACO has been considering the introduction of a combination of ARV drugs (Zidovudine, Lamivudine) to HIV-infected women during pregnancy. These multi-drug regimens are said to be more effective in preventing transmission of HIV from mother to the baby.

,
The incidence of new HIV infections appears to have stabilised for the first time in the 25-year history of AIDS, although the global pandemic will still have a deep, long-term impact, a new UN report said today.
,While the world is at last making progress against the disease, thanks to a massive increase in spending, better access to drugs and growing awareness, huge problems remain, the UN agency coordinating the fight against HIV/AIDS warned.
,In its report, issued on the eve of a UN General Assembly session on the disease, UNAIDS underlined the dangers caused by prevention programmes which it said in many countries were still far off-target and inaccessible to millions of people.
,''Overall, the HIV incidence rate (the proportion of people who have become infected with HIV) is believed to have peaked in the late 1990s and to have stabilised subsequently, notwithstanding increasing incidence in several countries'', UNAIDS said in the latest Report on the Global Aids Epidemic. 
,However, the agency warned that there was no room for complacency. ''We know what needs to be done to stop aids. What we need now is the will to get it done'', the report said.
,Aids has killed over 25 million people since it was first recognised in 1981, UNAIDS said, while the HIV virus which precedes the disease infected 65 million people over the same period.

,

,

,
,


,
The excitement over a novel class of drugs being developed to fight HIV has been dampened by fears that they could pose serious safety risks, including the possibility that they might actually speed the progression of AIDS.,The new class of drugs, called ccr5 receptor antagonists, blocks a secondary but crucial doorway typically used by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus to enter cells in the body. Researchers have known for more than a decade that people who lack a working version of that doorway, called a receptor, are, at best, highly resistant to infection by HIV and, at worst, slow to develop AIDS once infected.,From a treatment standpoint, drugs that provide the same benefit would be a welcome addition to the mix of medicines now used to fight HIV. More dramatically, the drugs would represent a shift in the fight against HIV, since they don't target the virus itself, as do the 27 other treatments already approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.,That difference is at the root of much of the concern surrounding the drugs. The drugs attack a target on human white blood cells that play an important role in the immune system.,''HIV profoundly affects the immune system. We are adding another layer of complexity by using a drug that also affects the immune system,'' said Veronica Miller, director, Forum for Collaborative HIV Research, George Washington University.,Even as development continues, there is a growing wariness about the future of the drugs. Most worrisome is that the drugs could accelerate a shift from one variant of HIV to a second. It also is unclear whether the drug would provide the same protection as occurs naturally in some people.,Nor do researchers know the long-term health effects of the drugs. Some of the drugs have been linked to liver problems and cancer. ""It is targeting a novel pathway with which we don't have a great deal of experience,"" said Dr Scott Proestel, an FDA medical officer. Indeed, a recent study found that the West Nile virus can be more lethal to people who naturally lack a working ccr5 doorway. Researchers warned the same could be true in patients treated with drugs that block that doorway.

A 15-year-old boy, on coming to know that his parents were HIV positive, committed suicide by setting himself ablaze at Amraiwadi here. Santosh succumbed to burns on Saturday. ,His parents who had kept their HIV+ status a secret so far, are in a daze. Their neighbours and the teachers of the boy, Santosh Sadguruprasad Baniya, too are shocked, as  Santosh had been behaving quite normally. They had not detected any sign of disturbance in him.,A few days back, Santosh's parents, who sell vegetables in Gulabnagar, had brought him Class X textbooks and a new uniform. ,Santosh, the second of four siblings, was in high spirits having passed Class IX, and wanted to study further, his grief-stricken  mother said.,His parents said he came to know that they were HIV positive and was worried about the future. In his dying declaration to Amraiwadi police too, Santosh said he was worried about his future and that of his siblings once his parents' die and thus had taken the extreme step.,His father said, ''He was happy after he passed his exams a few days ago. He showed no sign of aloofness or embarrassment. Maybe he had come to know that we were HIV positive.'',Head Constable Balwantsinh, who is investigating the case said Santosh had the desire to study further. ,''He was a jolly, energetic boy of our locality. Although he didn't seem disturbed or worried that day, he must have feared being ostracised by the society due to his parents' disease. Embarrassment and shame must have led him to commit suicide,'' said Ramashankar Prajapati, a neighbour.,His mother Urmila said, ''We never let our children know of our disease. We did our best to keep it secret, yet this happened. He must have read the diagnosis report. On Monday, he had asked me to buy Class X textbooks.'' ,His teachers who saw him on Monday last said they had seen no change in his behaviour or mood then.

And that 57 lakh of ""all age"" were affected by HIV/AIDS.,The Government's official figure is 52 lakh infected in the age group 15 to 49.,The committee, which will be headed by Director General ICMR N K Ganguly and co-chaired by Director General NACO Sujatha Rao, is working on a model to verify the UNAIDS figures for HIV.,A sub-committee set up under Mari Bhat, Director, Indian Institute of Population Studies in Mumbai, will for the first time work on arriving at an AIDS mortality figure for the country.,""Both reports will be released by the end of this year,'' said Arvind Pandey, Director, Institute of Medical Statistics, which will be coordinating both the studies.,UNAIDS country head Denis Brown said the assumptions on which the agency's figures are based have been passed on to the government.,The committees will also work to develop a new methodology for the AIDS count for 2007. Helping the committees will be National Institute of Epidemiology in Chennai, IIPS in Mumbai, PGI Chandigarh and RMRC in Orissa.,''The final model will be ready by February 2007,'' said Pandey.

Sourav Majhi, a six-year-old boy in West Midnapore, found his name struck off his school's list within days of admission allegedly because his father is HIV-positive.,The shocking incident reportedly took place in a government-aided private school called Nabankur Sishu Siksha Niketan, in Nabin Manua village of West Midnapore.,Sourav's father, Debashis Majhi, who is working with a DFID-funded PMO project on HIV-AIDS, was diagnosed as HIV-positive about two years back. However, both his wife and son tested HIV-negative at the School of Tropical Medicines in Kolkata.,On July 10, Majhi took his son to Nabakumar Sishu Shiksha Niketan, a neighbouring school, for admission in KG II. Sourav was admitted, and the family paid Rs 400 as admission fees. But trouble began just two days later.,''On July 12, the secretary of the school, Manoranjan Bhukta, came to our house and asked for Sourav's health certificate. He claimed that he knew I was an AIDS patient, and so would not allow Sourav to continue in school,'' alleged Majhi. ''I tried to convince the school secretary that there was nothing wrong with the boy,'' he added.,The next day, Sourav's grandfather, Shorishicharan Majhi, accompanied him to school. But they were not allowed to enter the premises. The school authorities even returned the admission fees.,''We showed them Sourav's health certificate which clearly states that he does not have the disease. But the authorities remained adamant, insisting that my boy is an AIDS patient and therefore would not be allowed to attend school,'' claimed Majhi.,He then sought the help of the village panchayat and other influential people in the area. But the school authorities refused to budge, said Majhi. Yesterday, he lodged a complaint with the Bengal Network for Positives (BNP) — the largest HIV-positive people's network — and the Health Department. The BNP has also lodged a separate complaint with the Health Department against the school authority.,Confirming this, R S Shukla, special secretary, Health Department, and director, West Bengal State HIV AIDS Prevention and Control Society, said: ''We are looking into the matter. What we generally do in these cases is to ask our HIV-positive network people to visit the place along with the victim. They submit a report after a through investigation. We then act on the basis of this report. We also get in touch with the local administration and ask them to sort out the problem.'',Tarit Chakraborty, president of BNP, said: ''The school authority has no right to question the HIV status of the boy, leave alone barring him from attending class on the ground that his father is HIV-positive. We have already forwarded the complaint to the State Health Department and voiced our protest regarding the incident.'',The school authorities could not be contacted despite repeated attempts. Meanwhile, Sourav has not been able to find a new school.

In 1992, at the Republican National Convention in Houston, Mary Fisher took America by storm by declaring in front of thousands of Republicans that she was ''HIV positive''. The bold statement then was a means to end the silence over the issue and get people, victims and others alike, to talk about the epidemic beginning to grip the world.,Fifteen years later, Fisher is special ambassador for UNAIDS and her latest platform, the XVI international AIDS conference in Toronto. But the message still is ''speak out''.,Fisher is not from an African ghetto where HIV prevalence is more than 30 per cent and every third person suffers from the disease. She is an affluent, white Republican, part of no stereotype. ''I decided to speak publicly as much as I could as I wanted people to act but nothing much has changed since then. Hope has not turned into reality, stigma has not been erased. Africa remains poor, Asia in denial and America has started fighting other wars,'' said Fisher.,''The American civil rights movement won voting rights for blacks as people kept on talking about the issue. But nothing is happening about AIDS as people find it redundant. The problem is there is no leadership. Nobody talks about HIV. For sometime, Mother Teresa tried giving voice to the voiceless. She died and things are the same.'',Fisher said the US Administration wasn't doing enough either. ''America is trying to take care of people with HIV across the world, but not doing much for its own people. We are great scientists but have not done a good job as far as AIDS is concerned,'' she said. ,She hasn't lost hope, though. Fisher founded the Mary Fisher CARE Fund at University of Alabama which supports long-term, outcome-based research for the care of people living with HIV, especially women, in the US and Africa. Also, mother of two teenagers, Fisher has authored books such as My name is Mary and I Will not go Quietly.,It hasn't been easy though, she admits. ''Initially, I thought I would die and was preparing to face death on a daily basis. My husband died in 1993 and I was a single mother...my children (however) did not face the stigma like in Africa...I will continue to do so as I have seen HIV-positive children and mothers die hungry in most parts of the world.''

A commonly used HIV medicine may also help prevent cervical cancer and could be developed into an anti-cancer cream, early laboratory tests by British scientists suggest.,Researchers at the University of Manchester said test-tube studies showed the drug lopinavir selectively killed human papilloma virus (HPV) — the virus that causes cervical cancer — as well as HIV.,Lopinavir belongs to a class of HIV drugs known as protease inhibitors. It is a key component of Abbott Laboratories Inc's best-selling pill Kaletra.,Dr Ian Hampson and his colleagues in Manchester believe lopinavir could eventually be made into a simple cream or pessary, offering an alternative to surgery for women with precancerous lesions.,No clinical trials have yet commenced, however.,Results of the team's early research will be published in Anti-Viral Therapy next month and will also be presented at the International HPV meeting in Prague on September 5.

Smoking, already linked to several illnesses, may also increase the risk of infection with HIV.,In a review of studies that looked at the association between smoking and HIV, British doctors said five of the six studies they analysed showed smokers had a higher chance of becoming infected. Nine of 10 other studies in the review that tracked the progression from HIV to AIDS found no link with smoking.,""The studies indicate that while smoking might be independently associated with acquiring HIV infection, it does not appear to be related to progression to AIDS,"" said Dr Andrew Furber of the South East Sheffield Primary Care Trust.,Furber and his colleagues, who reported the findings in the journal Sexually Transmitted Infections, said tobacco smoke may increase susceptibility to HIV infection by modifying a variety of immune system responses.,Research has shown that smoking is a leading cause of preventable death. It increases the risk of heart attack and stroke, respiratory problems, lung and other types of cancer.

In 1994, an incident here shocked the growing community of AIDS activists in the country. A 35-year-old woman was forced to drag the body of her HIV positive husband for more than 35 km as no one, not even relatives, would touch it. Fearing that the dreaded disease would 'permeate'the township if their crematorium was used, residents also ordered her to take the body out of town. So the woman conducted the last rites of her husband on a barren piece of land in the town's outskirts in Cuddalore district in north Tamil Nadu.,A decade later, things had changed little in this township, whose economy depends on the Rs 3,000-crore public sector Neyveli Lignite Corporation. In 2004, Natarajan Somasundaram, a casual labourer working in the Conveyor Maintenance Division of NLC's Mines-I, was declared ""medically unfit"" for regularisation. No reasons were given. But one of the doctors in the medical team helpfully advised Natarajan to have his blood checked as it had ""gone bad"". Later, the 48-year-old, otherwise healthy, widower and father of three boys went through screening at the nearby Cuddalore General Hospital and found he was HIV positive.,""I am physically fit to do my job. There have been no complaints about my work. I have no ailments. Then why is the NLC refusing to make me a permanent employee though it was the corporation's personnel department which called me for the health check (mandatory before the regularisation)?"" asked Natarajan. ,""There are 15 other employees who were rejected for a permanent post in NLC on medical grounds as they are all HIV positive. But they are too scared to come out in the open and confront NLC's might and fight the discrimination as they fear they will lose their temporary jobs as well,"" claimed K Senthil Kumar, project coordinator of the Cuddalore District HIV Positive Society. Natarajan himself had decided to fight the discrimination after much persuasion from Senthil.""There may be several more cases that have not come to our notice yet,"" said Senthil, pointing out that the NLC's action was ""clearly discriminatory"" and ""in violation of several path-breaking court judgments relating to discriminatory practices against HIV positives at workplaces"". ,""As a temporary worker I get only about Rs 3,000. If I am made permanent I will get at least Rs 12,000 besides all the other benefits,"" said Natarajan, who has been a temporary worker with NLC for 23 years. On June 5, 2006, Senthil sent a letter to the Director Personnel, with copies to NLC's chairman and MD S Jayaraman as well as the President, PM and Tamil Nadu CM, seeking an explanation. But, there has been no response yet.,NLC's Personnel Director Babu Rao told The Indian Express that he was not aware of Natarajan's case as he had taken charge only a month ago. ""We go by the company's rules. But, I don't think being HIV positive is criteria for disqualification. It definitely should not come in the way,"" he said.,With large numbers of migrant civil labourers from Maharashtra and AP descending on Neyveli town and villagers from nearby Virudhachalam also migrating to other districts for jobs as farm hands in sugarcane fields and bringing the disease back home, Cuddalore is emerging as a hotbed of HIV and Neyveli's 20,000-odd contract workers are the casualties.

Manoj Kumar, 35, has been spending Rs 9,000 per month on his anti-retrovirals (HIV/AIDS drugs) since 2002. Son of a farmer from Varanasi, the treatment has forced his father to sell off land worth Rs 6 lakh. ,Kumar's case is peculiar as the anti-retrovirals provided by the Government don't work for him and his doctors have put him on a higher level of drugs (second line of treatment), for which he has to pay from his own pocket. These include improved drugs like Tenofavir and Abacavir.,""I have two options — to live and pay huge amounts every month or just prepare to die,'' said Kumar. ""With the high cost of these drugs I don't know how long can I afford to live anyway,'' he added.,He is not the only one. At 10 am today, Kumar along with 20 people from across the country, began a protest sit-in at Jantar Mantar to get their voice to the authorities concerned. They will continue their protests till the morning of December 1 — World AIDS Day — when another 300 will join them.,""Their demand unlike most protesters is for their right to live,'' said Naresh Yadav, president of the Uttar Pradesh Network of Positive People. These are HIV positive persons who have failed the first line of treatment and are in huge debts paying for the second line of treatment that costs them anything between Rs 9,000 and Rs 15,000 per month. According to the networks, there are about 4,000 patients registered in various hospitals across the country who need similar treatment.,Though the Government has provided medicines for about 96,000 patients as against 47,000 under treatment with the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), these are only the basic first line of medication.,Under the Government's policy the new improved drugs are not available in Government hospitals and patients who have developed resistance to the first line of treatment have to buy them on their own. ""Our main effort is to provide the basic treatment for millions of HIV positive people. The second line of treatment is very expensive and we cannot afford to provide it free at this point,'' said Sujatha Rao, director-general NACO.,Before changing the treatment protocol, NACO is planning a drug resistance study in four centres. The study to be conducted by NARI (PUNE), Tuberculosis Research Centre, Chennai, NICD Kolkata and AIIMS in Delhi is likely to be started early next year.

,
The grim talk on India's AIDS problem has been around for some time but it has just got even grimmer: The country not only has the largest number of people living with HIV/AIDS in the world, but only 7 per cent of those who need treatment are getting it.,This has been revealed in the UNAIDS report 2006, released today. It is for the first time that UNAIDS has said that India has the highest number of people living with HIV/AIDS - 5.7 million. While the epicentre of the disease continues to be Sub-Saharan Africa, the report puts South Africa at No. 2, with 5.5 million infections.,While a range of 3.4 to 9.4 million cases has been given for India, South Africa has the range of 4.9 -6.1 million. The UN agency says 5.2 million people from the 15-to-49 age group in India are affected. Out of the total infections, 38 per cent are in women. However, perhaps the most shocking bit of data is that only 7 in a 100 patients have access to treatment. This puts India in the league of Sub-Saharan Africa and Russia where the treatment coverage is 3 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively. Even China, where an epidemic has been recognised recently, has better coverage than India's.,According to the report, Antiretroviral coverage varies considerably within regions — from 3 per cent in the Central African Republic to 85 per cent in Botswana.The report, which is based on disease surveillance around the world, says there were an estimated 4.3 million new HIV infections this year, with 2.8 million of these occurring in Sub-Sahara Africa. About 40 per cent of new infections were in people aged 15 to 24 years old. In 2006, 2.9 million died of Aids-related illnesses.,However, at other fronts there is some good news. Analyses of HIV data from 216 antenatal clinics and 132 sexually transmitted infection clinics for 2000-2004 suggest that HIV prevalence among women aged 15 to 24 years in southern states declined from 1.7 per cent in 2000 to1.1per cent in 2004. ,HIV infection levels fell also among men aged 20 to 29 years who, attended such clinics in the south. But there was no evidence of a decline in northern states. The trend has been attributed to a rise in use of condoms by men visiting sex workers in southern India.  ,However, sex workers are still an area of concern. According to the report, a large proportion of women with HIV appear to have acquired the virus from regular partners who were infected during paid sex.

Andhra Pradesh, among the worst hit by HIV/AIDS in the country, is set to become the first state to pass a legislation to make it mandatory for couples to undergo HIV testing before they can get married. According to officials, the intention behind the move is to make sure that there are no HIV positive babies born in the state by 2007.,The issue was discussed today in the Andhra Assembly, shortly after Chief Minister Y S Rajasekhar Reddy and  other MLAs took HIV tests.,Andhra Pradesh Principal Secretary (Health) P K Agarwal said that the government has not yet decided on how exactly the new measure will be implemented. He said the Assembly had not yet passed any legislation on this but had only discussed it. ""The climate in the state is right for such a Bill and legislators are serious about bringing in such a legislation. So a formal Bill should be passed soon,'' he said. Sources said that such a Bill is likely to come up for approval in the March session of the Assembly.,Agarwal said that the thinking behind such a move was to make sure that no children are born with the disease. ""Sex is one of the main reasons that the disease is passed on. If it is known that the parents are HIV positive, then medication can ensure that the child is not born with the disease. Just because the parents have the disease, it does not mean that children have to get it as well,'' said Agarwal.,According to international AIDS charity AVERT, HIV prevalence at antenatal clinics was around 2 per cent in 2004 and 2005. ,That figure is higher than in any other ,Indian state. NACO estimates that more ,than 400,000 people are living with HIV in Andhra Pradesh. ,Maharashtra and AP together account ,for 10 per cent of the country's HIV-affected people, and the the International HIV/AIDS Alliance warns of a larger HIV epidemic ,if adequate control measures are not applied effectively.,AP plans to ensure 'Zero HIV Positive child to be born in the State from 2007'. The campaign has been named as '0/7'. ,Chairing the first state level committee on AIDS recently, CM Reddy said ""we should evolve a programme to see to it that at least the newly born children do not get affected by the disease. We should take steps to test every delivery case and prevent newborns from getting affected"".,According to Health Minister K Rosiah, contraceptive measures are not very popular in the state. ,""Since condom use is not very popular, we are considering tough measures like compulsory HIV testing, "" he said.,Agarwal said that the government ,would have to organise a large number of consultations with concerned parties, ,including Medical institutions and NGOs, before a method of enforcing such a law could be decided upon.

A court on Tuesday convicted five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor of deliberately infecting 400 children with the HIV virus and condemned them to death, provoking shouts of approval from the children's relatives.,""God is great!"" yelled Ibrahim Mohammed al-Aurabi, the father of an infected child, as soon as the presiding judge finished reading the verdict in the Tripoli courtroom.,Bulgaria swiftly condemned the decision, and reiterated its belief that the children were infected by unhygienic conditions in their Benghazi hospital.,""Sentencing innocent people to death is an attempt to cover up the real culprits and the real reasons for the AIDS outbreak in Benghazi,"" said parliamentary speaker.,The accused did not react as the judgement was delivered. They have the right to appeal to the Supreme Court.,The presiding judge, Mahmoud Hawissa, took only seven minutes to confirm the presence of the accused — who all answered ""yes"" in Arabic — and read out his verdict and sentence in the most politicised court process in modern Libyan history.,The defendants, detained for nearly seven years, had previously been convicted and condemned to death, but Libyan judges granted them a retrial last year after international protests. Bulgaria contends the children were infected by unhygienic practices at the Libyan hospital.

,
Circumcision appears to reduce a man's risk of contracting AIDS from heterosexual sex by half, United States government health officials have said, and the directors of the two largest funds for fighting the disease said they would consider paying for circumcisions in high-risk countries. ,The announcement was made by officials of the National Institutes of Health as they halted two clinical trials, in Kenya and Uganda, on the ground that not offering circumcision to all the men taking part would be unethical. The success of the trials confirmed a study done last year in South Africa.,AIDS experts immediately hailed the finding. ""This is very exciting news,"" said Daniel Halperin, an HIV specialist at the Harvard Center for Population and Development, who has argued that circumcision slows the spread of AIDS in the parts of Africa where it is common. ,Uncircumcised men are thought to be more susceptible because the underside of the foreskin is rich in Langerhans cells, sentinel cells of the immune system, which attach easily to the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS. The foreskin also often suffers small tears during intercourse. ,But experts also cautioned that circumcision is no cure-all. It only lessens the chances that a man will catch the virus; it is expensive compared to condoms, abstinence or other methods; and the surgery has serious risks if performed by folk healers using dirty blades, as often happens in rural Africa. Circumcision is ""not a magic bullet, but a potentially important intervention,"" said Kevin M De Cock, director of HIV/AIDS for WHO.

,
Methods used to estimate the number of people with HIV/AIDS in India are flawed and the actual number of cases, thought to be the most of any country in the world, may be significantly lower, according to a study published today.,While the report does not calculate the total number of HIV/AIDS sufferers in India, Lalit Dandona of the Administrative Staff College in Hyderabad, who led the investigators, said his research team believes the actual number to be between 3.2 million to 3.5 million adults. ,The government says there are 5.2 million infected adults and the United Nations estimates that 5.7 million Indians, including children, are infected.,Health officials had praise for the report but challenged some of its conclusions, saying the study's sample — from a single district of 4.5 million people—- was too small to infer results for a country of more than a billion people.,Dandona's study, published in the London-based journal BMC Medicine, says methods used by the government and United Nations to estimate the number of HIV/AIDS cases may be inaccurate.,""India may be overestimating its HIV burden with the currently used official estimation method,"" said the report, based on research in the Guntur district in Andhra Pradesh which indicated that the number of HIV-positive people may be only 40 percent of the official estimate. ,The report said the investigators collected blood samples from 12,617 people aged 15-49 years, a representative sample of the adult residents of Guntur. Andhra Pradesh is the state worst hit by AIDS and Guntur one of the worst-affected areas in the state. Their method estimated there were 45,900 people with HIV in Guntur, compared to the estimate of 112,600 reached by the official method, which uses data from ante-natal clinics, sexually transmitted infection clinics and public hospitals, the study said.,Dandona said he believed there was no intentional effort to inflate the numbers, but the official method, known as ""sentinel surveillance,"" gave a flawed picture because the amount of HIV-positive people reporting to these clinics and hospitals was not representative of their true numbers in the population. This is because patients at public hospitals are generally from poorer segments of the population where HIV infection rates are higher, and the fact that HIV/AIDS sufferers are referred there from private institutions, artificially raising their percentage.,""Even though our numbers are smaller, we are by no means suggesting that the problem is already taken care of,"" Dandona said. Denis Broun, the head of UNAIDS in India, called it ""a good study and definitely useful,"" but noted that there were problems with Dandona's methodology. The study compares its findings for the district with figures obtained from the sentinel survey for the whole state, which does not necessarily represent the district exactly, Broun said.,""Even if it were right in Guntur, it would not mean it is right all over India,"" he said. Broun, who said that the Staff College was highly respected by the UN and other agencies, acknowledged that the UN has revised its figures downward in some cases in the past. ""I'm perfectly ready to consider that the (official) figures may be overstated, but the result just from Guntur is not enough yet,"" he said. Broun said better figures would be available in early 2007 when the 2006 sentinel information and a national household survey are available.

,


,
Continuing his recent home stay spree across rural Karnataka, the Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy will stay at the residence of a HIV positive family in the high HIV prevalence Bagalkot district of Karnataka. ,Kumaraswamy, who inaugurated a comprehensive Rs 98-crore USAID-funded HIV prevention and care program 'Samastha' on Wednesday, said he would be staying with a family comprising HIV positive persons on January 23 in an effort to ""show we care and to give confidence to HIV positive people."" ,""We commit total support to the Samastha project. Stigma still remains a challenge in tackling HIV/AIDS. I will spend a night in the home of a person living with HIV. I would like to send out the message that nobody has the right to discriminate against people living with HIV,"" the CM said. He has over the past few months been involved in a series of home stays across the state in what he calls an effort to reach people at the grassroot levels. He has stayed at the homes of poor Dalits and Muslims over the period. ,Kumaraswamy's political detractors have called the Chief Minister's rural home stays a ""political gimmick"" aimed at building the image of the Janata Dal Secular leader. The home stays bring more inconvenience than benefits since the Chief Minister will not use the basic facilities at the homes and would require special arrangements for food, sleep and toilets, the Opposition has said. ,But, a representative of the Karnataka Network of HIV Positive People, Asha Ramaiah, welcomed Kumaraswamy's decision to stay at the home of a HIV positive person and said it would help address stigma and discrimination to some extent. ,The home of the HIV positive person that the Chief Minister will stay at in Bagalkot will be announced later on account of security reasons, the Chief Minister's Office said. ,Bagalkot district is one of the high HIV prevalence districts in Karnataka on account of the existence of ancient practices like the Devadasi system and the socio-economics of the impoverished district. The Samastha project is intended to strengthen HIV/AIDS prevention, care, support and treatment in 12 districts, including Bagalkot, and three major cities in Karnataka. ,""Karnataka is the only state with a rural HIV prevalence that exceeds the urban prevalence rate. This highlights the need for concentrating on Karnataka with a comprehensive HIV/AIDS program that focuses on the rural areas in the northern districts,'' USAID mission director George Deukin said. ,As part of Samastha initiatives, Karnataka government affiliates working in the area of HIV/AIDS will try to identify 100 highest-risk villages in the 12 districts. The villages are to be identified on the basis of social criterion like number of sex workers, mobility of work force and co-existence of new wealth and extreme poverty.

HIV patients can look forward to consuming pills only once a day. Studies underway at the National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) to determine the efficacy of anti-HIV drugs taken just once a day so far have proved 'safe' . Patients are doing well, say researchers, a year after the study was undertaken. ,To ensure that patients do not miss out on their dose and assuming that it is easier to pop pills just once, NARI along with Chennai-based Y R Gaitonde Centre for AIDS Research and Education (YRG Care) launched this National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded study in India last December. The A5175 is a phase IV randomised, open-label, three-arm, anti-viral efficacy trial designed to evaluate three antiretroviral (ARV) regimens. ,There are 18 other sites where the NIH-sponsored multi-centric study is underway. These include Thailand, Haiti, Brazil, Malawi, Peru, Harare and nine sites in the US itself. A total of 1,520 participants will be enrolled worldwide and will include men and women who are above 18, infected with HIV and whose CD4 cell count is less than 300. ,Dr Shrikant Tripathy, Deputy Director, NARI and principal investigator of the study told The Indian Express around 71 HIV positive men and women have been enrolled. YRG Care has completed the enrolment process, while NARI will complete the enrolment of a total of 100 patients in the next five months. ,Treatment commenced six months ago. This is a two-and-a-half year study and so far the patients undergoing treatment are doing well. There has been no adverse reaction, Tripathy said. ,As part of the study, the researchers decided to use anti-HIV drugs which have longer half-life. These include emtricitabine (FTC) and atazanavir plus didanosine enteric coated (ddI-EC) for the trial participants. These tablets are being given just once day. Normally, most HIV treatments have patients consuming pills twice a day. This is because a drug like Zidovudine (ZDV) cannot be given just once a day, Tripathy explains. ,Hence the trial is a randomised one where one group of 33 HIV infected trial participants consume lamivudine and ZDV twice a day, while efavirenz (EFV) is taken once a day. Another batch will be exposed to drugs like FTC, atazanavir and ddI-EC that have to be consumed once a day, while the third batch will be given other anti-HIV drugs. If this initial regimen fails then patients will be put on the second regimen for the management of presumed antiretroviral drug resistance.

,

,

,
,


,
To raise the level of awareness regarding HIV/AIDS among migrant labourers from Orissa, working in Gujarat, Gujarat State AIDS Control Society (GSACS) has set up six Information Communication Technology (ICT) kiosks across Surat, Alang and Sosiya.,The population of Oriya workers, essentially single and male, is highest among migrant workers in these regions and they are vulnerable to high risk sexual behaviour leading to enhanced threat of HIV/AIDS infection.,Talking to Newsline, Joint Director GSACS, Dr Rajesh Gopal, said that while a conservative estimate of migrant labourers from Orissa in Surat city alone would be close to 7.5 lakh, there exist large concentrations of them in the shipbreaking yards of Alang and Sosiya.,""They are essentially single male migrants in the 15-40 age group,"" said Gopal adding that their age and isolation make them most vulnerable to HIV infection. ""Another important factor is their living condition,"" said Gopal adding that often 10-15 labourers stay cramped in one room, which is extremely conducive for homosexual practices, leading to enhanced threat of HIV/AIDS infection.,""We focused on the Oriya population first due to the large concentration of these labourers in a particular city,"" said Gopal adding that while so far about 8 to 10 cases of HIV positive cases have been officially reported, no representative figure of HIV victims among these groups is available with  GSACS. ,""Another complex issue we face is that in case one among these labourers is detected positive, he/she returns to the native state and then it becomes almost impossible to track that person down,"" Gopal added. ""We have set up four ICT centres at Surat and one each in Alang and Sosiya,"" he said, adding that these kiosks are equipped with Internet connection and web cameras, which would help the migrants to communicate with their families back home in Orissa. ,""Geographical distance and isolation at times push these labourers to high risk sexual behaviours,"" said Gopal. ""Through these kiosks they can get in touch with their families in a better way and we hope it will diminish the emotional isolation greatly,"" he added.,Further, these kiosks would serve as a on-stop referral points for the labourers where information on health is concerned. ""When these labourers indulge in high risk sexual behaviour and contract STD, they visit quacks instead of a trained doctor as they find it difficult to communicate in any language other than Oriya,"" Gopal said. ,""The best part of these kiosks is they provide relevant information in Oriya,"" said Gopal adding that one can access an array of information material including printed booklets, CDs and so on regarding HIV/AIDS. The centres also provide a database of NGOs working in this area and pertinent health information. ,""The centres would give names and addresses of concerned doctors and testing centres necessary to address their health issues as well,"" Gopal added. Further, the centres would also serve as an entertainment hub for the labourers with the provision of indoor games. ""This would help divert them away from high risk sexual behaviour like homosexuality and visiting commercial sex workers,"" said a source working with a kiosk in Surat.

,

,
,


,
Trials of a microbicidal gel to prevent HIV infection during sex have been halted in India and Africa after an independent scientific committee found that the active ingredient, cellulose sulphate, increased the risk of women contracting the virus.,Some scientists consider this a setback because microbicidal gels, creams or suppositories are seen as a cheap way to prevent the spread of AIDS in poor countries, especially in women whose partners refuse to use condoms. ,Cellulose sulphate was developed as an anti-HIV microbicide by Polydex Pharmaceuticals of Toronto and its trials were being conducted across the world by Conrad, a health-research group based in Virginia. ,According to Conrad, the independent committee had found, in a small study of its own, that more women using cellulose sulphate developed HIV than those using a placebo, or inactive gel.,In India, the Conrad trials were being implemented by YRG Care, Chennai, and St John's Medical College, Bangalore.,""We were told to stop the trial on January 27,"" said Dr Reynold Washington, a professor at St John's who is the principal investigator for the trial in Bagalkot district of Karnataka. ""Yes, it's a great setback as microbicides are being perceived as a new tool to prevent HIV."",Dr Washington said it took a long time to find and enrol participants and counsel them. ,""We had enrolled 20-25 women who were HIV negative and the trial had only begun as the government had given clearance only last year,"" he said. ""We have not had any sero-conversions, which means those who are HIV negative have not turned positive."",However, he said his team had learnt valuable lessons in setting up trials, managing data, building confidence among participants, and adhering to good clinical practices. ,For Dr Suniti Solomon, Director of YRG Care, Chennai, too the halt is a ""huge disappointment."" YRG Care had enrolled 250 women,  including sex workers who were not HIV positive. ,""They (Conrad) had found problems at a site in Africa last year itself and had immediately told us to stop the trial here, in October last year,"" Solomon said.,Like in the Bagalkot study, none of the participants in Chennai had contracted the HIV virus, said Solomon.,Scientists are particularly surprised at the calling-off of the trial for cellulose sulphate, because it had already reached Phase-III, after clearing multiple safety trials. In 2000, another microbicide on trial, nonoxynol-9, had been declared unsafe.,Trials continue, however, on two other microbicides, Pro 2000 of Indevus Pharma, and BufferGel of ReProtect and Carreguard, whose trademark is held by the Population Council.

Those HIV infected in India can heave a sigh of relief, as Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) will no longer be expensive and CD4 count test will done free of cost at 105 ART centres in the country. ,All these plans, part of the third phase of the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP-III), will be launched in April, National ART consultant B B Rewari told The Indian Express. ,Earlier, the government had announced its decision to provide free Anti-Retroviral Treatment to at least one lakh HIV infected by 2005, but faced several hurdles in the process, including setting up of ART centres. ,Now, the number of centres has increased to 105 and a total of 56,000 HIV infected persons were availing free ART, Rewari said. ""We have enough drugs for one lakh patients and the government has strengthened its Information Education and Communication (IEC) activities,"" he said, adding Rs 80 crore had been spent on ART alone. ""The National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) has provided 58 CD4 count machines and are in the process of procuring 38 new ones,"" he said. ,The CD4 count test, done to check the immunity level of the patient and identify the stage of the disease, costs Rs 1,000. The burden, however, was reduced to Rs 500 by subsidising it.  ,Now, with the test free of cost, Rewari said that would encourage early detection of the virus. ,With NACP-III scheduled to commence in April, micronutrient supplementation will also be provided to those with HIV.

,
The national drive to provide free antiretroviral (ARV) and anti-TB drugs to HIV-affected children has run out of steam in its third month. The programme was launched by former US president Bill Clinton and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi on World AIDS Day (December 1) last year. ,Several children who were being administered paediatric dosages as part of the National Paediatric HIV/AIDS Initiative in 82 ARV centres across the country have been put on adult dosages due to shortage of drugs. In Tamil Nadu alone, 894 HIV-positive children had been brought under the paediatric programme.This has affected adherence to the medication schedule and caused trauma, say officials of ARV centres in Tamil Nadu.,Spearheaded by the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), the programme was supposed to provide free dosages of ARV drugs to children. The latter have so far been available only in adult measures to children above the age of nine. The initiative also involves nutritional supplements. But the nutrition supplement is being provided only at a few centres. ""We have run short of ARV drugs, particularly Efavarenz used by HIV-positive children suffering from tuberculosis,"" said a senior officer at an ARV centre in Tamil Nadu, who requested anonymity.,According to reports from Namakkal, which covers five districts in Tamil Nadu, and the Tiruneveli ARV centres, several HIV-positive children had to be administered adult dosages from February 1 following ""depletion of stocks"". ,Tamil Nadu officials accused NACO of ""mismanagement"" and attributed the shortage to ""mismatch in data collation"". ""It looks like they have given wrong data about the requirements of the 82 centres across the country,"" said a senior official. ,""Yes, some of our centres are facing a shortage. We hope to send some stocks on Monday,"" conceded Supriya Sahu, director of the state-run Tamil Nadu AIDS Control Society (TANSACS).,""The number (of children under the paediatric programme) far exceeded our expectations,"" said Sunil Raj, programme officer, Paediatric Care, NACO.  ""But, we should be able to sort out the problem in the next two weeks,"" he added. ,Raj explained that while 36 ARV centres had initially come under the Clinton Foundation-sponsored paediatric initiative, the number subsequently went up to 82. And NACO is still in the process of collecting data, he said. ""And a percentage of every stock of drugs goes for quality checks to ensure they adhere to international standards,"" he pointed out, which is another cause for the disruption in supply. ,The Clinton Foundation had announced a donation of $35 million (of the $50 million required for the project) for providing 10,000 free paediatric doses of ARV drugs in Delhi, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. At present, only 3,050 HIV-positive children are being covered under the programme. Official estimates put the number of HIV-infected children in the country at 2,02,000 and the number of infected children being born every year at 56,700.

A man, suspected to be a mentally deranged, set afire a medical counsellor who refused to declare him HIV-positive, at the Jabalpur Medical College on Tuesday afternoon. ,Sanjay Shrivastava, a counsellor at the Voluntary Counselling and Testing Centre (VCTC) run by Madhya Pradesh AIDS Control Society, suffered 80 per cent burns and was said to be critical. ,Kaushal Jaiswal had been visiting Shrivastava for the last few days insisting that he be declared HIV-positive though his tests had come out negative. ""He used to ask for medicine though he was not HIV+. When I turned him away on Tuesday he set me afire in the cabin,"" Shrivastava said before losing consciousness. The counsellor was sitting in his third-floor cabin when Jaiswal doused him with kerosene and set him afire. ,An eyewitness saw Shrivastava screaming and running down the passage. He was immediately taken to the burns ward. Hospital superintendent Dr Pradeep Kasar said: ""Shrivastava is critical, we can't say anything at the moment."" ,Additional SP Manohar Varma said drugs were recovered from a bag Jaiswal left behind before fleeing from the spot. The drugs were apparently meant for treatment of a psychological disorder, he said. ,Jaiswal is a resident of Churhat tehsil in Sidhi district and used to frequent Jabalpur for treatment. He was referred from Bhopal to Jabalpur VCTC because the town was closer to his village. The society, however, said it was not aware when Jaiswal was referred because it maintains secrecy about patients. ,Varma said police had not found any other motive behind Jaiswal's act. But, it seemed Jaiswal had come prepared and was carrying several matchboxes. No one prevented him from carrying the jerrycan into the cabin, nor did anyone see him leave. Varma said Jaiswal had once tried to immolate himself, though he could not provide more details. ,A resident of Sagar, Shrivastava had joined the VCTC when it was inaugurated in February 2000. The Centre also has a female counsellor and a laboratory assistant. The counsellors guide patients on HIV/AIDS and take their written consent before testing them. ,Jaiswal was held from near the medical college in the evening. He told the police that he carried the can in a sling bag and set Shrivastava afire after he refused him medicines again. He said he came to Jabalpur on February 24 and stayed near the hospital surviving only on water and juice because he threw up solid food.

In a bid to stabilise the HIV epidemic in the country, the Central government will introduce the treatment in a large way for the first time. ,In the third phase of its National Aids Control Programme, which starts next month, will look to provide 3 lakh patients with Anti-Retroviral Treatment (ART) free of cost and an additional 40,000 children between the ages of 0-15. ART, the multi-drug treatment, prolongs life and enhances its quality among people living with HIV/AIDS.,The National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) has doubled its number of ART centres for Phase III from 56 centres to 120 centres across the country. In phase II only 65 thousand patients were treated. The treatment for children, which was started in December 2006, has so far medicated 3,700 children. The Clinton Foundation is providing the drugs. ,"" We are looking to continue our focus on prevention but we want to introduce treatment in a big way. This will have many benefits,"" says K Sujatha Rao, director NACO.,The primary benefits will be that infected individuals will be able to live normal lives with the help of the drugs. Secondly, the individual will reduce the chances of transmission as long as he follows the regular preventive measures along with taking the drugs. The average cost of treatment worked out to around Rs 8,000 per patient a year.,The new phase of the programme, which will cover the next five years, will also look to modernise the entire blood transfusion centre system. ""We want to focus on volume access as well as the quality of blood. This will help not only in the transfusion of HIV but also other diseases such as Hepatitis B and Malaria. We want to be able to provide safe blood at reasonable prices and eliminate private trading and increase more donations,"" said Rao.,For this the government will be looking to tie up with the Red Cross and is also looking towards a few German companies for financial aid.,The new phase will also shift its focus from states to districts as new hot spots have emerged in the last phase. There has also been a decline in Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. NACO is also looking into providing fortified food for people living with HIV.1

By breast-feeding only, HIV-positive mothers reduce the risk of postnatal HIV infection in their babies, South African researchers report.,The study, published in the March 31 issue of The Lancet, also found that early introduction of animal milk and solid foods while breast-feeding increases the risk that infants will be infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.,The findings suggest that current World Health Organization, UNICEF and UNAIDS infant-feeding guidelines need to be revised, said researchers from the University of KwaZulu-,Natal. They found that infants of HIV-positive mothers who received formula milk in addition to breast milk were nearly twice as likely to be infected by HIV as infants who received breast milk only. The addition of solid foods increased the risk of HIV infection in the infants 11-fold.,The death rate at three months for babies who were fed animal milk or solid foods was more than double that of babies who received breast milk only, the researchers found. ,""The key finding of our study is the definite demonstration that early introduction of solid foods and animal milks increases HIV transmission risks compared with exclusive breast-feeding from birth,"" the study authors wrote.

,
Although the DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment, Short course) strategy to treat tuberculosis in the country started 14 years back, the programme faces several stumbling blocks. It seems the coming together of the TB and the HIV programmes is a huge challenge to the effective implementation of DOTS. ,Since 60 per cent of HIV positive patients develop TB, centres that treat HIV positive patients have started administering TB drugs. In the past six months, around 11,842 patients with HIV have been infected with TB across the country and immediately put on DOTS. ,On March 24, which is observed as anti-TB Day, the government will not only launch a disease prevalence survey to understand the exact burden of tuberculosis across the country, but also aim at strengthening cross-referral linkages — HIV to TB and vice versa. ""TB patients coming to the HIV department and vice versa will be strengthened,"" said Dr L S Chauhan, Deputy Director General (Tuberculosis) and programme manager of the National TB Control Programme. ,At present, around 6.8 million cases of TB have been treated under DOTS since the inception of the national programme in 1993. As many as 1.4 million cases of TB were brought under the DOTS programme in 2006. ""TB patients getting infected with HIV is a huge challenge to the effective implementation of the DOTS programme,"" Chauhan said, adding that the Central TB Division has started documenting data on this issue in the past six months. ,""We are collaborating with the HIV prevention and control programme officials and referring TB patients to their department. The identity of the patient is not disclosed,"" Chauhan said, adding that a training module has been developed for officials in both TB and HIV departments. ,The HIV-TB coordination programme is being implemented in the six highly-affected states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Nagaland and Manipur with HIV prevalence of over one per cent. ,If HIV is a posing a challenge to the DOTS programme, then multi-drug resistance to anti-TB drugs is another cause of concern. According to the latest survey conducted by the Central TB Division, there are less than three per cent of multi-drug resistance MDR-TB patients among the new cases. And there are around 1.8 million new cases of TB every year.,The DOTS programme has been expanded to DOTS-PLUS to handle emerging cases of MDR-TB across the country. However, Chauhan admits that the treatment is expensive and around 15 laboratories will be set up in the country by 2008.

Cloistered by two decades of war and then the strict Islamic rule of the Taliban, Afghanistan was long shielded from the ravages of the AIDS pandemic. Not anymore. HIV and AIDS have quietly arrived in this land of thousand calamities. It remains almost completely underground, shrouded in ignorance and stigma as the government struggles with the help of American and NATO forces to rebuild the country in the face of a new offensive by Taliban insurgents.,The few surveys that exist suggest that Afghanistan has a low prevalence of HIV—only 69 recorded cases, and just three deaths. Yet health officials warn that the incidence is certainly much higher. ""That figure is absolutely unreliable, even dangerous,"" said Nilufar Egamberdi, a World Bank consultant on HIV/AIDS. The WHO feels that 1,000 to 2,000 Afghans are infected, but Egamberdi said even that was ""not even close to reality"". Dr Saifur Rehman, director of the National AIDS Control programme in the Ministry of Health, agreed. ,International and Afghan health experts warn that Afghanistan faces the additional vulnerabilities of countries emerging from conflict—lack of educational and governmental services, mass movements of people and a sudden influx of aid money, commerce and outsiders.,Geography and migration make Afghanistan particularly susceptible. It is surrounded by countries with the fastest-growing incidence of AIDS in the world—Russia, China and India. Other neighbours, Pakistan and Iran, have high levels of drug addiction and a growing number of HIV infections, as does Central Asia to the north. Rates of drug addiction are rising in Afghanistan, with its booming opium trade.,""In Afghanistan, all the traditional risk factors for rapid spread of HIV exist concurrently,"" according to Dr. Fred Hartman of Management Sciences for Health, a Boston-based group working in Afghanistan.,,KABUL: A suicide car bomber rammed his car next to a US Embassy convoy on Monday, killing an Afghan teenager and wounding five embassy security personnel on a notoriously dangerous stretch of road. The two other US vehicles were also damaged, and flames shot through the wreckage of the suicide car bomb. Five US Embassy security personnel were injured, one seriously. The US ambassador, Ronald Neumann, was not in the convoy, the embassy spokesman said.,Meanwhile, Daniele Mastrogiacomo, a reporter for the Italian daily La Repubblica, was released by the Taliban after two weeks in captivity in Helmand province. Italian Premier Romano Prodi said securing Mastrogiacomo's release ""was not simple"" and that more details would be released later.,Also, according to a survey released on Monday by the independent Integrity Watch Afghanistan, about 60 per cent of Afghans said the current administration is more corrupt than any other in the past two decades.

Prime Minister John Howard on Friday said that people with HIV should not be allowed to migrate to Australia, and that the government was investigating whether it could tighten existing restrictions.,Asked in a radio interview whether people with the virus that causes AIDS should be allowed into Australia as migrants or refugees, Howard said, ""My initial reaction is no."",He said that there may be ""humanitarian considerations"" in certain cases, and that he would like to take ""more counsel"" on the issue.,""I think we should have the most stringent possible conditions in relation to that nationwide, and I know the health minister is concerned about that and is examining ways of tightening things up,"" he said.,Howard was asked about the issue during a visit to Melbourne, the capital of Victoria state, where the state health minister said this week that 70 of the 334 new HIV infection cases reported in Victoria in 2006 were among immigrants who had arrived in the country with the virus.,Don Baxter of Australian Federation of AIDS Organizations said HIV tests were among health checks prospective immigrants were given already, and infection was already a cause for rejection on the grounds that an HIV-positive person could impose an unfair burden on the public health system.""It's very tight already,"" Baxter told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.,Many countries, including the US, impose restrictions on immigration and visa approvals for people with HIV.,,Sydney: Australian Prime Minister John Howard on Friday suggested that Australians should treat the country's senior Muslim cleric as ""a joke"". Howard made the comment after Egyptian-born mufti Sheikh Taj Aldin al-Hilali reportedly said he was ""more Australian"" than the Prime Minister whom he likened to former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.	 ,

While HIV prevalence rate above 5 per cent is considered dangerous, in Chandigarh it stands at a high 17.6 per cent. Add to it the threat posed by the presence of 3,970 sex workers, 1,200 homosexuals, 1,112 injecting drug users and eunuchs in the city. The disturbing figures thrown up by a survey of the State AIDS Control Society (UT) has set the alarm bells ringing. ,According to Dr Sonia Trikha, Project Director of the Society, more than 40 samples out of 250 collected last year tested HIV positive. Referring to the presence of large number of female sex workers in Chandigarh, Trikha said, besides the slum areas, sex workers are also operating from proper residential areas. She said many are coming to the city from places like Ropar. ""We have provided 600 condom depots in different places and are trying to educate people regarding the use of condom. The use of condoms have increased in recent past,"" she added. While efforts are being also made to motivate the injecting drug users to quit the habit, they are also being provided with new syringes.

,
A study published in the US Journal of Infectious Diseases says that the HIV virus has not been suppressed in a significant number of patients put on Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) in India and that there is a need for a second line medication.
,It is the largest study that raises the question of how HIV positive patients are faring on ART, says Amita Gupta, assistant professor and deputy director, Centre for Clinical Global Health Education, Division of Infectious Diseases, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore.
,An estimated 5.7 million persons live with HIV infection in India. Of these, an estimated 0.7 million have AIDS and require ART. With the aim to assess ART adherence and virologic suppression, a cross sectional study was conducted among 279 HIV-infected individuals who were receiving ART in three private, outpatient clinics in Mumbai. 
,The study was conducted between December, 2004, and April, 2005, and researchers from the North Carolina Medical centre, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore and Human Healthcare and Research Foundation, Mumbai, have reported that 40 per cent were failing their ART.
,""The goal was that the virus should be undetectable,""says Gupta. Unfortunately, the HIV viral load test is very expensive (approximately Rs 4,000 per test). The test is rarely done here. In high income countries, the viral load test is done every three months in the first year of the therapy and then every 3-6 months depending on the response and other factors.
,Researchers found a detectable viral load (more than 400 copies/ml) in nearly 40 per cent patients. This means that the HIV virus was detected in four out of every 10 patient receiving ART. This suggests that response of many patients was not optimal or they were failing their ART. They found that women were more likely to be suppressed and that family support was important to help them adhere to the therapy.
,Researchers admit the study has limitations due to the small sample size, yet it is the first of its kind in the country. The study highlights the need for a second line treatment in a proportion of patients.
,
Pune: Maharashtra is planning paediatric camps to identify children infected with HIV and to provide them care and support. The identification is part of an ongoing exercise to ensure that children with HIV are put on medication and anti-retroviral treatment (ART). A day-long meeting was held on Tuesday at the Central Institute of Road Transport to decide on strategies to identify such children. 	,

After helping the Latur quake victims in 1993, Kerala-based Father Tomy decided to take a breather at Panchgani, a hill station in Maharashtra. It was a decision that not only changed his life but also turned the fortunes of the dilapidated Bel Air Hospital, now one of the best HIV treatment and care centres in the country. ,""I remember the day I stumbled upon this huge place with broken buildings and a hospital with no doctors. I still don't know why I stayed back,"" recalls Tomy, the director of Bel Air. ""One day I was checking the records and came across a plaque of Sir Dorabji Trust. I went to meet Rusy Lalla, the trust president, and apprised him of the situation. He asked me how much money I needed. I demanded Rs 5 lakh and he gave me Rs 20 lakh. Since then there has been no looking back,"" says Tomy, adding that he has collected Rs 45 crore from donors. ,Founded by Dr. Rustomji Billimoria in 1913 as a sanatorium for patients with tuberculosis, Bel Air enhanced its scope in 1995 when it decided to take in AIDS/HIV patients. This at a time when HIV positive people were practically ostracised and refused admission by hospitals and private institutions. ""The place belonged to the Indian Red Cross Society and was run by a Catholic priest. How could we refuse the patients who had been rejected and thrown out by their own families and doctors?"" asks Tomy.,In 1964, the institution was transferred to the IRCS, and in 2000, the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) sanctioned the first and biggest community care centre in the country. Enthused by the success of the programme and encouraged by President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam,  Bel Air has now been entrusted with setting up an Anti-Retroviral Treatment (ART) centre, the first in the NGO sector. Tomy has been nominated as chairperson of the technical resource group. ,A visit to the 300-bed hospital is an eye opener. Be it the 20-odd HIV positive staffers who were treated at the institution and now work as drivers, gardeners and watchmen, or the new lot of volunteers, everyone loves the place. ""You don't want to leave Bel Air. I came here from Surat to cure my TB, but stayed on,"" says 83-year-old Erach Gadiyali, the oldest staffer. ,Till March this year as many as 4,265 HIV patients had been admitted and treated, while 500 are treated every month. Patients in Bel-Air are provided lodging, food, basic medicines and routine investigations free of cost. Patients are usually charged for the costly antibiotics and expensive investigations, though most of the patients are poor and can't afford it. But Bel-Air makes every effort not to deny treatment to those who can't pay, says Father Sebastian, adminstrator. ,To tackle stigma and discrimination, Bel Air has conducted 19 training programmes for 460 doctors and has started a College of Nursing in association with the University of Illinois, Chicago, with special focus on HIV/AIDS. The hospital has also launched a communication campaign with the support of USAID, Avert Society and the Johns Hopkins University. ,But it hasn't always been easy. Tomy has had to fight local politicians and land sharks who wanted the 44 acres of prime land at Panchgani, has been slapped with 62 cases in various courts, even accused of rape. The municipality did not allow hospital staffers to cremate HIV positive bodies and agreed only on the condition that they would wash the crematorium afterwards. But Tomy continues relentlessly. As he says, ""We want to show that we can make Satara district HIV free."" Given his tenacity, he probably will.

""I HAVE no words to express my feelings. My dream has come true,"" said a beaming Geeta (name changed). It was only last Thursday that she had told this correspondent that her one wish before she breathed her last was to enter a classroom. ""I want to feel how it is to sit in a classroom,"" she had said. ,On Monday, the world as they knew, turned on its axis for Geeta and 25 of her friends—all HIV/ AIDS affected—when they stepped into the classrooms of a zilla parishad (ZP) school. ,Following a report in The Indian Express on June 15 about schools in the Yashwantnagar suburb of Sangli not allowing HIV/AIDS affected children from the Bhagini Nivedita hostel to enter classrooms, the state Government and district administration swung into action over the weekend to ensure that 28 of the 40 HIV affected children were permitted to attend classes in two schools — as many as 26 in a zilla parishad school and two in a private management high school. ,All 28 were welcomed to the respective schools around 10 a.m. today with flowers, chocolates and books. Meanwhile, it's been decided that 11young children, aged around four, will remain inside the hostel for one more year as they may prove too young for the school teachers. One girl, aged 18, is engaged in vocational training in the campus itself.,When contacted, District Collector Rajendra Chavan said, ""I was shocked when I read The Indian Express report and ordered a probe into the case. The Block Education Officer and headmasters of the schools visited Bhagini Nivedita the next day to find out the facts."" The other state Government officials who made a beeline to the hostel included officers from the District Women and Child Welfare Department and the state CID—the latter reaching Sangli on Saturday to take stock of the situation. ,""We held a meeting of school teachers, headmasters and hostel authorities. It was decided to correct past mistakes by welcoming the children with flowers and books,"" said Namdeo Mali, Block Education Officer, Miraj Panchayat Samiti. ,Neeta Damle of Bhagini Nivedita said, ""It was the happiest moment in the kids' lives when they stepped out of the hostel premises to go to school today morning. Education is their right and now teachers should ensure that these kids are not discriminated against."",Meanwhile, the district administration is launching a drive to enlighten parents and teachers to clear their misconceptions about HIV/AIDS. ""We will continuously communicate with parents and teachers,"" said Chavan. ,Mali said the welcome was arranged in such a fashion that the 28 children did not have occasion to come under special scrutiny. ""All students in the schools were given flowers and books so that affected kids were not identified. ,Teachers in the school have promised to protect the identity of the affected children,"" he said. ,For children, the first day of school was unforgettable. ""It was a completely new world for me with new books, chocolates and new friends. I want to study hard to become a doctor,"" says Vishwas (name changed) who firmly believes that he will recover to serve people.

""I know I'm going to die soon but before I breathe my last I want to enter a classroom and sit with boys and girls of my age. I want to feel how it is to sit in a classroom."",These are the words of 12-year-old Geeta (name changed), who has HIV/AIDS and is not allowed to enter her school here. She is one of the 40 children at Bhagini Nivedita, a special hostel for HIV-affected children in Sangli city in southern Maharashtra, who are being denied schooling.,There are four schools in the area — two zilla parishad schools, one high school and one municipal school — where these children can go. But they are not let in. Authorities at all these schools refused to comment when The Indian Express contacted them.,Out of the 40 children, 10 are just four years old and need admission to kindergarten. Many of them have in fact been given admission as per school records, but none is allowed to enter the premises and sit in their classrooms.,The main reason given by the schools is: parents' objection.,Geeta, who was orphaned a few years ago when her parents died of HIV-related illnesses, and other children of school-going age at the hostel have been learning their letters and numbers within the walls of Bhagini Nivedita. They are shepherded once a year to isolated examination halls in their respective schools to sit for the annual exams.,""We impart informal education to these kids, teaching them to read and write,"" said Neeta Damle, who works with Bhagini Nivedita.,The local school authorities do not talk about this issue. But a teacher told The Indian Express that ""parents of other children won't allow HIV-affected students to share the same room as their own kids"".,""They have put immense pressure on the school managements to keep them out,"" he said.,Maharashtra's Minister of State for School Education, Hassan Mushrif, said : ""This is a serious matter and I will personally take it up with local officials."",Damle had asked the zilla parishad to appoint a teacher for the hostel kids but the primary education officer at Sangli, N B Patil, said: ""We can't appoint a teacher who will go and teach these children separately.""

Researchers have found that five out of every 100 HIV-infected mother develop active TB within one year after delivery. In India, the chances of death for such mothers are two-fold and for infants it's three-fold.,A study recently published in the Clinical Infectious Diseases journal has concluded that there's high incidence of postpartum TB among Indian HIV-infected women and associated postpartum maternal and infant death. The study was jointly conducted by scientists at Pune's B J Medical College, Johns Hopkins' School of Medicine and the Bloomberg School of Public Health, US. ,Jayagowri Sastry, one of the researchers, told The Indian Express that more than 100,000 pregnant women have been educated, counselled and tested for HIV in Pune since 2002 as part of an ongoing US National Institutes of Health-funded clinical trial to prevent transmission of HIV from mother to child. As part of this study, mothers and their infants were followed up to one year postpartum and their health status assessed frequently, including their risk for TB and death. A total of 715 HIV-infected mothers and their infants were kept under watch for a year after delivery at the Sassoon General Hospital in Pune. Twenty-four of the 715 HIV infected women developed TB out of which three died. Among 23 infants with mothers  infected with TB, two were diagnosed with TB and four infants died. This has led the researchers to recommend the active screening and targeted use of isoniazid preventive therapy  among HIV-infected women in India

In a breakthrough that could potentially lead to a cure for HIV infection, scientists have discovered a way to remove the virus from infected cells, a study released on Friday said. The scientists engineered an enzyme which attacks the DNA of the HIV virus and cuts it out of the infected cell, says a study published in Science magazine.,The enzyme is still far from being ready to use as a cure, the authors warned, but it offers a glimmer of hope for the more than 40 million people infected worldwide.,""A customised enzyme that effectively excises integrated HIV-1 from infected cells in vitro might one day help to eradicate (the) virus from AIDS patients,"" Alan Engelman, of Harvard University's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, wrote in an article accompanying the study.,Current treatments focus on suppressing the HIV virus to delay the onset of AIDS.,What makes HIV so deadly, however, is its ability to insert itself into the body's cells and force those cells to produce new infection.,""Consequently, the virus becomes inextricably linked to the host, making it virtually impossible to 'cure' AIDS patients of their HIV-1 infection,"" Engelman explained.,That could change if the enzyme developed by a group of German scientists can be made safe to use on people.,That enzyme was able to eliminate the HIV virus from infected human cells in about three months in the lab.,The researchers engineered an enzyme called Tre which removes the virus from the genome of infected cells by recognising and then recombining the structure of the virus's DNA.,This ability to recognise HIV's DNA might one day help overcome one of the biggest obstacles to finding a cure: the ability of the HIV virus to avoid detection by reverting to a resting state within infected cells which then cease to produce the virus for months or even years.,Researchers were also optimistic about developing additional enzymes which would target other parts of the virus's DNA.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati on Friday suspended two doctors of Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial Medical College here after they refused to assist in the delivery of a HIV-positive woman, leaving her husband to deliver the baby. ,Assistant Principal Dr Urmila Karya and Dr Abhilasha Gupta, the officiating head of the hospital's Gynaecology Department, have been suspended with immediate effect after a probe conducted by the Acting District Magistrate. ,Earlier, the woman's husband Raees Abbas had said that the doctors refused to come to his aid despite repeated pleas and kept shouting instructions from a distance. ""I had to cut the boy's umbilical cord myself. Later, they made me clean the bed and burn the soiled clothes outside,"" Abbas claimed. ,Sources said efforts were on to suppress the matter after it was flashed on TV channels on Friday. However, Abbas is happy with the apology offered by the hospital, though it was a senior eye surgeon who came to him. ""We could not refuse him as he had cured my eye ailment,"" Abbas's mother said, adding that they don't want anyone's career ruined. ,Abbas said his wife tested positive for HIV last May. However, he and her three children tested negative--two of the children are from her first marriage. Abbas does not know how his wife contracted HIV. ""She's never had a blood transfusion, only a glucose drip,"" he said. ,Talking to reporters after a preliminary probe, Acting DM Roshan Jacob said the hospital had deputed residents to handle the case and there was prima facie negligence on the part of many senior doctors. Jacob said all this happened though the woman had been undergoing treatment at the AIDS ART centre of the hospital for the past three months. ""This shows a lack of coordination between various departments of the college. There were systemic failures too, which need to be rectified,"" she added. ,A two-member team of the National AIDS control Organisation is also probing the matter. However, the team expressed surprise at how Abbas could have performed the delivery himself. They claimed the hospital had conducted a Caesarian section on another HIV positive woman 12 days back.

A popular theory on how HIV attacks the body's immune system is wrong, a new study has found. Scientists have long believed that HIV causes the slow depletion of healthy white blood cells—the T-cells which recognise infections so the body can fight them off—by causing infected T-cells to produce virus particles before dying. This ongoing cycle of infection, HIV production, reinfection and cell destruction has been called the ""runaway"" hypothesis.,But if this were so, the T-cells would be killed off far too quickly, the researchers found.  Using a simple mathematical model, researchers in the US and Britain showed the ""runaway"" model would deplete the body's healthy T cells in a matter of months, instead of the years it actually takes.,The results show that a ""slow process must be active"" in the depletion of the T cells, the authors wrote in the current issue of the journal PLoS Medicine. Identifying this process ""will provide a key insight into the nature of HIV disease,"" they concluded.

In a unique initiative, the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) has signed an MoU with Ballarpur Industries and ACC Cement to provide free anti-retroviral drugs at their therapy centres. ,Joint Director (IEC) NACO Mayank Agarwal told The Indian Express that the move was part of a public private partnership. NACO aims at providing a supportive environment, specially when corporate conglomerates such as Ballarpur Industries and ACC Cements have joined hands to fight HIV/AIDS under the aegis of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). ,The corporate anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centres are being facilitated by CII for workplace employees and even nearby communities suffering from HIV. NACO will provide free diagnostic test kits (HIV/CD4), ARV drugs (first line) and drugs for opportunistic infections at Ballarpur Industries' unit in Chandrapur, Maharashtra and at the ART centre of ACC Cements at Wadi in Karnataka. These centres will be recognised as NACO designated centres. ,Meanwhile, a project—Access to Care and Treatment (ACT)—has been initiated by CII along with four other NGO partners through a consortium approach. The consortium comprises Population Foundation of India, Engender Health, Freedom Foundation, Indian Network of Positive People and CII. Corporate India has responded by having a workplace policy which includes a plethora of services which corporates have signed up for.,What's more, India Inc is training employees to conduct HIV/AIDS awareness sessions at the workplace. HUL, Pepsi, Coca-Cola, SRF group, Bilt, Apollo Tyres and Transport Corporation of India are some of the companies which have partnered the International Labour Organisation (ILO), whereby the ILO trains the companies' employees on disseminating information about HIV/ AIDS at the workplace. ,Not only that, corporates are educating truckers about HIV/ AIDS prevention, control and care at their factories and have also tied up with the state AIDS control societies for awareness sessions.

The five schoolchildren of Pampady village in Kottayam who picked up HIV at birth from their parents don't know if they will ever see the inside of their school again as a committee deliberates what to do with them.,The parents of the other children, who have been keeping their wards away from the school, today got local politicians and the school management to ensure that the HIV+ children stay away for a week. Consequently, the school saw full strength today.,The five, including a boy in kindergarten, two girls in Class II and two more girls in Class IV, belong to northern Kerala districts. Separated from their HIV-infected parents and brought to the other end of Kerala by a church-based NGO, Ashakiran, the children were a year go admitted to the local lower primary school at Pampady. The MDLP School is a church school run on government aid, with its address showing it as belonging to an orphanage of the NGO.,But six months ago, protests started, with parents of other students, who feared their own kids might get infected, asking Ashakiran to withdraw them. ""We are not against letting those poor kids have an education. But why should we, the poor, alone take the risk? Why can't the Ashakiran head, who manages a high-end public school for the wealthy barely a kilometre away, dare to enroll even one of them there?"" asks Rajan, one of the protesting parents.,According to him, the parents had even told the NGO that they would let the other kids study in the village school with their own if one of them is admitted to the public school. Sources with the church body, however, claim that the kids are just not capable of coping with the CBSE syllabus being followed in the public school. ,Other issues are surfacing too. ""Why couldn't the NGO let the kid stay with their parents in their own villages and go to school there?"" asked another parent. Ashakiran functionaries were not available for comment.

To educate jawans posted in the Northeastern region on HIV/AIDS, a regular health programme would be organised by paramilitary forces in the different outposts. This decision was taken at a five-day training workshop given for counselors on HIV/AIDS at the BSF headquarters on Friday. ,As part of its effort to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) conducted training for paramilitary forces — CRPF, BSF, CISF and Assam Rifles — at the BSF headquarters in Shillong. Twenty-two para-medics staff also attended the camp.,BSF Inspector General (Assam-Meghalaya) P K Misra asked the counselors to be ""practical"" when educating the men in uniform. He said that the jawans posted in NE region like Imphal, Churachandpur, Lunglei Demagiri and Chupkacharing have to know about the deadly disease thoroughly. Misra said, ""We have men infected by HIV/AIDS and this is the right time to wage a war against it.""

,

,
,


,
Health Minister Anbumani Ramadoss is quoted as having said, ""We have spent so much on the programme and finally the results are there"" ('India's Aids Scare Just Got Halved', IE, July 7).,Results? Is the health minister kidding? India's HIV/AIDS re-estimates, conceded after getting National Aids Control Programme-III (NACP-III) approved by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs for a programme based on 5.2 million HIV-numbers, is a long overdue correction of inaccurate estimates, arbitrarily boosted since 1998 and long challenged by many experts. Ramadoss needs to do serious introspection on his ministry's functioning.,The large population-based blood-test sampling from the National Health Fertility Survey and the Guntur district community study, highlighting a 60 per cent difference from surveillance estimates put forward by NACO, has for the past year provided incontrovertible, large-scale evidence of inflated HIV-estimates. This was critically documented as early as 2000 by the Independent Commission on Health in India (ICHI) Experts Consultation in a report that was provided to the health ministry and NACO.,The ICHI report pointed to arbitrary hikes: NACO's end-1994 estimate of 1.75 million HIV-infected spiralled to 4 million by 1998. Challenged, NACO temporarily downplayed the figures. Then another NACO Expert Group (1999) developed a different estimation process that placed HIV-infected in the range of 2.4 to 3.7 million in 1999. Subsequently, NACO arbitrarily picked the higher end, adding a 20 per cent variable. This base figure has steadily grown. Alongside, the steady expansion of sentinel surveillance sites — 55(1994) to 703 (2005) — diminished scientific longitudinal tracking. The ICHI had noted at the start of NACP-II: ""Flawed estimates at the outset could result in scams of enormous public expenditures vindicated through notional reduction of 'infections averted' from levels not scaled in the first place!"" ,The point bears repetition as NACP-III launches with a seeming correction of the statistical parameters. The AIDS scare has halved but the health minister's gung-ho response to the changed figures is scary. He appears to be claiming results from large sums of money spent in controlling numbers that did not exist in the first place. He also promises more ""vigorous funding"", despite overwhelming evidence of mismanagement during NACP-II and even while other vital areas of healthcare perceptibly lag. ,Just as pertinent are the issues surrounding NACP-III's strategic thrust. Two-thirds of Rs 11,585 crore are earmarked for prevention but the bulk is for the NACP-III centrepiece: Targeted Interventions for High-Risk Persons (TIHRP) focus on three major categories: commercial sex workers (CSW); men having sex with men (MSM); and injecting drug-users (IDU). It is a minimal package but is ironically termed comprehensive. Altogether, Rs 6,000 to 7,000 crore is allocated for the narrow ""non-judgmental, non-interfering"" servicing of high-risk persons even as there is nothing to proactively reduce high-risk exposure or promote alternative low-risk lifestyles, despite specific directives to NACO for broadening prevention issued by the HRD parliamentary standing committee examining immoral traffic prevention act amendments.,The TIHRP operational targets are prime indicators for monitoring NACP-III achievements. But how realistic are the targets set? The NACP-III Expert Group on High Risk Persons Estimations dismisses out of hand as ""crude estimates"" the ""mappings"" of high-risk persons conducted by each state through expensive, extensive research comprising major NACP-II activities. ,Other financial points require scrutiny: only Rs 8023 crore are within the national budget. Of this Rs 5162 crore is from external aid and is concentrated on TIHRP/condom-provision/STD-services, with just token attention being paid to care treatment, exposing India's sleaziest aspects to outsider involvement. India's contribution — Rs 2861 crore — absorbs Rs 2,400 crore from the National Rural Health Mission, suborning it to HIV/AIDS as primary healthcare is already to contraception/immunisation/pulse polio. The biggest outlay — Rs 2000 crore — is for condoms, with just Rs 24 crore for clean blood storage! Further, a government committed to downsizing provides Rs 418 crore to a manifold increase in NACO's strength of 800, with 1,371 new posts and 1,200 contractual appointments.,What are these figures really based on? The fiscal farce arising from showering scarce resources on inflated numbers is one part of the story. The other is the social, ethical and law and order implications of such unprecedented and large-scale collectivisation of high-risk individuals. The whole approach needs deeper consideration lest the whole strategy boomerangs. ,,

Congress MP Rahul Gandhi today promised to look into the need to provide insurance for HIV positive people in the country. As of now, most insurance companies are turning away HIV patients, refusing to provide them insurance cover. ,Gandhi was apparently moved after a 28-year-old widow from Indore narrated her plight to him at a meeting of the Indian Network of Positive People (INP+) here today. The mother of two said her insurance company had refused her claim following her husband's death in 2004. ""The company said he was suffering from AIDS and therefore was not entitled to any payment,"" said the woman who has been fighting with the company for the past three years. ""The MP has now promised to help me,"" she said. ,""I somehow make ends meet with the Rs 3000 I earn as an outreach worker of an AIDS awareness organisation. It's an uphill task bringing up the two children, sending them to school and paying the rent. But I won't give up,"" she told The Indian Express. ""Thankfully, my children are not positive."" After her husband fell ill, she too tested positive in 2003. She was thrown out by her in-laws after her husband's death. ""We had been paying the premiums regularly. The insurance money will be a boon,"" she added. ,It is for empowering women like her that INP+ has formed a National Women's Forum, with branches reaching right down to the district and taluk level, says treasurer Jahnavi Goswami. ""It's important to spread information about the help and rights that HIV+ women are entitled to,"" Goswami added. The four-day INP+ meet, which concluded on Thursday, called upon the Government to expedite the tabling of the HIV/AIDS Bill in Parliament to check the discrimination meted out to HIV+ people.

The National Institute of Research in Reproductive Health, Mumbai has something new to offer in the fight against HIV. Scientists at the institute have developed a broad spectrum microbicide which can prevent HIV infection.,The new formulation—Carrageenan Buffer Gel named NISCAR—is an effective anti-HIV agent, besides being an effective anti-STI (sexually transmitted infection) agent and a contraceptive, says Deputy Director Dr K V R Reddy. NIRRH has already carried out pre-clinical safety tests of the gel on animals, and the National AIDS Research Institute, Pune too has confirmed its anti-HIV property, said Dr Smita Kulkarni of NARI.,Microbicides are formulations in the form of gel, cream or tablet that can be applied inside the vagina to prevent sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV. At present, some 60 compounds are being evaluated across the world for their microbicidal qualities, and researchers believe, if successful, microbicides may empower women against HIV.,India, now, has two clinical trials to look forward to — the Praneem polyherbal vaginal tablet that has completed phase II trials at NARI, and a global trial of another microbicide, tenofovir gel.,NISCAR is a peptide that is used for food preservation and anti-bacterial activity. It is isolated from bacteria (Lactococus lactis) and is cationic (positively charged) in nature, something that differentiates it from other microbicides, which are undergoing phase III trials on humans and are mostly synthetic.

She is being brought up by her aunt Kaushalya, who has three children of her own.,""One day, her schoolteacher summoned me and inquired if Sarbjit was HIV positive. I said she was. The teacher then said that Sarbjit has a wound near her eye, which has shown no signs of healing. The other children in school might get infected and so Sarbjit should not be sent to school. What could I do, I stopped sending her and they sent home her school-leaving certificate,"" said Kaushalya. ,Sarbjit is a good student, said her cousin Kulwinder Kaur, also in the same school. ""Everyone in the school feared her. They knew that her parents had died due to AIDS and she is carrying the virus. There was panic when she got that cut on her face,"" she said. She told her classmates and teachers that the virus does not spread by shaking hands with or sitting beside the infected person, but no one paid any heed. ,Her aunt said that she never discriminated Sarbjit from her children.

The school-leaving certificate, dated July 3, 2007 (a copy available with The Indian Express), bears signatures of the school headmistress Sawinder Kaur. ,The principal said everyone in school was aware that the girl child was infected with HIV, but it was her injury that was causing panic. She, however, added that they struck off her name following a request from her guardians. The school authorities were not happy that she was not attending classes and wanted to help her, but the child's aunt was not willing to send her to school, the principal said. When asked if Sarbjit's guardians had given any written request to strike off her name, she said she would have to check the records.

Two weeks after pharmacists in Imphal sent out a distress signal over shortage of medicines, a number of  HIV/AIDS NGOs have come together to form the Taskforce for Empowering in Addressing Medical Issues (TEAM) and have submitted a memorandum to Governor S S Sidhu. Manipur has been facing a drug crisis for more than a month due to extortion demands served on medicine manufacturers. Nearly 200 major and minor drug companies have stopped their supplies to the state. ,NGOs Lifeline Foundation, SASO, Manipur Network of Positive People, CARE Foundation, Kripa Society and NEIHRN, which came together to form TEAM, have urged the state Government to consider the concerns of HIV-positive patients who are on the life-saving Anti-Retro Viral (ARV) drugs. ,What TEAM is most apprehensive about is that if there is a shortage of ARV drugs, there is a risk of high resistance building up due to a break in the lifelong course. ,According to official figures, there are over 26,000 HIV/AIDS patients in Manipur and many of them are on first-line ARV. Of them, only around 3,000 are able to avail this medicine free of cost at Government-run ART (Anti Retroviral Therapy) centres. The rest buy it from the open market. This medication specifies that the drug should be taken without a break. If first-line ARV drugs run out, users will develop a very high resistance to it and will have to take recourse to second-line ARV drugs, which will cost Rs 8,000-9,000 per month. For those already on second-line ARV, lack of the same will mean switching to third-line ARV, which is not available in India. ""By not taking action, they are pushing us to the edge,"" said a senior TEAM member. ,The NGOs in their appeal for prompt Government action have also set a 10-day deadline. It has pledged to address the issue and to approach the Manipur Human Rights Commission to organise a public hearing on the right to healthcare.

Why do some people infected with the virus that causes AIDS become overwhelmed by the virus while others are able to hold the pathogen in check? Scientists writing in a recent issue of the journal Science say the answer seems to centre on variations in the genetic makeup of people, a finding so deceptively simple that it has drawn the attention of high-ranking administrators at the National Institutes of Health. ,NIH director Elias A Zerhouni said the research ""could lead to improved HIV therapies and provides new targets for vaccine developers"". Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, one of the 19 institutes in the NIH, praised the work as revealing how genetic factors influence how a host responds to infection.,""People vary greatly in their vulnerability to HIV infection,"" Barton Haynes, who heads an HIV/AIDS centre, said in a statement. ""In particular, there are striking and largely unexplained differences between individuals in the degree to which they are able to hold viral levels to a low set point in the period soon after infection. ,""If scientists could pinpoint the gene variants that help some people control HIV infection — or avoid it altogether — they might be able to rationally design therapies or vaccines to mimic these naturally occurring genetic advantages,"" Haynes added.

A study conducted by doctors of the Armed Forces Medical Services (AFMS) has shown that a detailed analysis of HIV-positive personnel in the armed forces can be instrumental in developing an effective vaccine for the disease in the country.,The study, published in the latest AFMS medical journal, contests that service personnel form a handy pool of individuals representing population from different regions of the nation and can be used to understand the geographic distribution and evolution of the virus. Findings of the detailed survey of 70 service personnel conducted by a panel of top AFMS doctors, including two retired Lieutenant Generals, confirmed that subtype C is the most prevalent subtype of the virus in the country. However, the report said that a study on the emergence of multiple subtypes was necessary to design an effective vaccine suited for the Indian subcontinent.,""Study of the genetic diversity of HIV-1 is significant in understanding the biological behaviour of the virus, modes of transmission, geographical distribution of the subtypes and selection of the most prevalent subtype in a defined region for selecting a candidate vaccine,"" the study says.,The study adds that ""service personnel and their families represent a divergent population from different regions of India"" and a study of the subtypes in these individuals would have ""significant implications"" for development of a vaccine.,While the incidence of HIV-positive cases in the armed forces has shown a declining trend during the last five years — figures quoted in Parliament by Defence Minister A K Antony reveal that the number went from 501 cases in 2001 to 377 cases in 2006 — the study confirmed that the primary mode of transmission among defence personnel is sexual contact. The study was conducted by Col A K Sahni of Base Hospital, Delhi, Col R M Gupta of AFMC, Brig S K Nema of Lucknow Command Hospital and others.

Fewer cases of genital ulcer diseases and increase in condom use over time has led to a sharp decline in HIV incidence among patients attending Sexually-Transmitted Infection (STI) clinics. A Pune study for the first time has provided direct evidence of how a significant decline in HIV infection rates in female sex workers and men with STIs has been achieved.,According to Dr S M Mehendale, Deputy Director (senior grade) NARI and the principal investigator of the study, the HIV incidence rates were analysed among three cohorts, male, female non-sex worker and female sex worker (FEW), attending STI clinics in Pune over ten years. ,The relative risk of HIV infection decreased by approximately 80 per cent among male patients with STIs and by 70 per cent among FEW during the ten-year study period.,Dr Mehendale told The Indian Express that the aim was to study how many persons who were negative at the beginning of the study became HIV positive (this is called seroconversion or a new case of HIV infection. Incidence is calculated by taking the number of persons who become positive during the follow up study). ,Between 1993 and 2002, 14,147 patients attending the STI clinics were screened for HIV, of whom 3,185 (22.5 per cent) were HIV infected. A total of 3,268 individuals not infected with HIV participated in the study. In all, 274 seroconversions (new HIV infections) were identified over a period of 10 years.,The finding of declining HIV rates among high-risk men and FSWs is not just good news for Pune, but results are important because they indicate that significant decline in HIV infection rates can be achieved in high-risk individuals in the country, Mehendale pointed out.,National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) scientists have in their study published in the August issue of the US-based Journal of AIDS said that this was the first direct evidence of a decline in HIV incidence rates in female sex workers (FSWs) and male patients with sexually transmitted infections (STIs) over time in the country.,Interventions like the extensive counselling employed at our site for risk reduction in behaviour, condom promotion, and aggressive management of sexually transmitted diseases have led to this decline, the NARI scientist said.,An area of concern was identified as the lack of change in the risk of HIV infection among the non- FSWs. There is a need for additional targeted HIV prevention interventions, said Mehendale.

The Additional Sessions Court of Jaipur on Friday stayed the order of a trial court which denied a HIV+ widow custody of her daughter. The court will hear the case on October 11. ,Last week, a lower court in Alwar had denied the 27-year-old woman, the widow of a former Armyman, the custody of her daughter, as she was HIV+. The woman, a resident of Jhunjhunu, contracted the virus from her husband, who had full blown AIDS and died in 2003. ,The woman alleged that her in-laws, who live in Alwar district, threw her out of their home after she refused to part with the money she had received as compensation after her husband's death. Her in-laws wanted to buy land with the money, while she wanted it to be kept away for her daughter. ,When she was turned out of the house, she was also not allowed to take her daughter with her. ,Having been once denied custody by a lower court, she then appealed in the sessions court for her daughter's custody. She also wants her in-laws to return the dowry she brought with her on marriage.

A lower court in Alwar has denied a widow the custody of her nine-year-old daughter because she is HIV-positive.,The District Magistrate of Alwar has ordered that the child remain with her paternal grandparents, with whom the widow from Jhunjhunu has been battling since the time her husband died in 2003. It was last year that she went to court.,Addressing a press conference on Thursday with support from the People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) and Positive Women's Network, Meena (name changed) said her husband was an armyman who had died of AIDS and that she had contracted the HIV virus from him.,""I was married in 1995 and my husband tested HIV-positive in 1997. His family decided to go for Ayurvedic treatment. He died of AIDS in 2003, and I had caught AIDS from him in 2000,"" she said. ,She said she continued to live with her in-laws after her husband's death.,""Initially everything was fine. But then they started demanding money from the Rs 4 lakh compensation I had received. They wanted to buy land. I refused to give them all of the money as I wanted to keep it for my daughter, so they threw me out,"" she said.,Along with her parents she visited her in-laws last November to seek custody of the child, but they turned down her request. She said she had no choice then but to approach the court.,""I was heartbroken when the court said my daughter should remain with her grandparents,"" said Meena.,""She is my daughter, I am her natural guardian and would like to look after her, raise her. I have lost everything already —  my husband, relatives, and I am also an HIV carrier. I can only hope to live for my daughter,"" she said.,Her lawyers have now filed a revision petition in the Additional Civil Court, Jaipur. They have also demanded that her in-laws return the compensation money she received on her husband's death and the dowry she brought with her on marriage. Said Kavita Srivastava of PUCL, ""Initially, following wrong legal advice, she filed a case of illegal detention against the grandparents, which the court obviously rejected. Later, her lawyers filed for custody of the child. Even that was not given.""

,

,

,
,


,
At least 100 medical interns and resident doctors at the Sassoon government hospital had to pop anti-HIV pills for 28 days after they suffered needle stick injuries while working in the hospital.,Even as healthcare workers are known to get accidentally exposed, mainly through needle stick injuries, to blood from patients infected with HIV, the study at SGH, one of the first in the country, found that medical interns were at the highest risk.,The joint study sponsored by Johns Hopkins University was conducted over a period of three years and the findings were presented by Dr Amita Gupta at the Johns Hopkins University at the 46th annual conference of Infectious Diseases Society of America at San Diego, in October this year.,Principal investigator of the project Dr A L Kakrani, Head of the Department of Medicine at SGH and B J Medical College, said that more than 700 such needle stick injuries were recorded during the period. The group that was exposed most to the needle stick injuries was of medical interns. ,At least 100 persons suffered needle stick injuries and half of them were medical interns, followed by resident doctors. While the risk of transmission of HIV from patient to doctor via needle stick injuries is .3 per cent, according to Kakrani, there are around 70-80 cases worldwide where doctors have turned HIV positive.,Needle stick injuries are wounds caused by needles that accidentally puncture the skin. If not disposed of properly, needles, concealed in linen or garbage, can injure other workers unexpectedly, says Kakrani. ,Doctors with needle stick injury were given drugs for 28 days. Kakrani explained that the virus remains localised in the area of injury for a maximum of three days. Drugs given within three hours of the needle injury is effective and kills the virus before it multiplies. A combination of two drugs —lamivudine and stavudine— were given to most doctors and a three-drug combination of lamivudine, stavudine and indinavir were given to some of the doctors. None of the doctors tested positive for HIV.

,

,

,
,


,
Researchers in India and United States are keenly awaiting the results of a multi-centric trial that focuses on how an HIV-infected mother can prevent the virus from being passed on to her newborn. This ambitious trial that got underway at Pune's B J Medical College and Sassoon General Hospital in 2002 has been completed. The results to be declared in a week's time are crucial as they will pinpoint on how to lower the rate of HIV infection to infants who were exposed to breast milk. ,In fact, pregnant women who are HIV positive, can halve the chances of passing HIV on to their babies by taking antiretroviral drugs. Treatment options include a one-month course of zidovudine (AZT) during the last weeks of pregnancy or a single dose of nevirapine during delivery followed by a single dose to the infant within 72 hours of birth. In Pune, B J Medical College and Sassoon General Hospital enrolled an approximate 730 women for this trial, dean of the college Dr Arun Jhamkar said.  ,The principal investigator of the trial, Dr M A Phadke who is also the Vice Chancellor of the University of Health Sciences at Nashik, said the results will be declared shortly. The trial, which is an Indo-US study that costs Rs 2 crore, was sponsored by US-based National Institutes of Health (NIH) and was simultaneously started at other countries, Dr Phadke told The Indian Express. ,The follow-up of enrolled participants was underway until September this year. The study in Pune has been done jointly with National AIDS Research Institute, Pune Municipal Corporation and health clinics of Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation and other NGOs. ,Key investigators in India, US, Ethiopia and Uganda are waiting for the results. ""We expect the initial results to be available to all of the investigators soon,"" said Phadke. No concerns have been raised about the safety of this trial, according to a communication of international, independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), she added.,,India has an estimated 2.5 million HIV-infected individuals and the percentage of HIV cases attributed to mother to child transmission has increased almost ten fold from 0.33 per cent in 1999 to 2.8 per cent in 2004. With an estimated 27 million births occurring annually in India and an assumed vertical transmission of at least 25 per cent in the absence of any mother to child transmission intervention, this is expected to lead to greater than 24,000 HIV infected children each year, researchers Robert Bollinger from Johns Hopkins University and Amita Gupta and Jayagowri Sastry from B J Medical College point out in the August 2007 issue of Indian Journal of Medical Research. ,A study of a small group of 41 HIV infected women who chose not to exclusively breast feed their infants was also conducted. The anti HIV drugs were given to the women and the infants also received a single dose of nevirapine. Out of the 42 infants — 32 were formula fed and 10 were mixed fed. Four infants were diagnosed with HIV infection. Out of the formula fed babies, transmission occurred in only one infant at fourteen weeks. This small study suggests that a short course of AZT or a single dose of NVP is effective in reducing Mother to Child transmission in the Indian setting.

,
As many as 100 HIV uninfected women from Pune have successfully completed the phase II trial of the Tenofovir vaginal gel — a microbicide — that women can use to protect themselves against HIV. Another 100 women in the US have also nearly completed the trial. ,""With the completion of the crucial phase II trial, this gel will now move on to the third phase to test its efficacy in preventing HIV transmission,"" Dr Smita Joshi, project in-charge and senior research officer at the National AIDS Research Institute (NARI), told The Indian Express on Monday. ,The trial was conducted by NARI at the Jehangir hospital in Pune. A part of the HIV Prevention Trial Network (HPTN) project, it was funded by the National Institutes of Health, USA. ""Basically, vaginal microbicides will help women protect themselves against HIV and other sexually transmitted infections when they cannot negotiate condom use by men,"" Joshi said. ,The phase I of the trial was conducted in the US in 2004 to assess the safety of Tenofovir gel manufactured by US-based Gilead Pharmaceuticals. ""Phase II assessed the long-term safety of the drug and the 100 participants were enrolled both in Pune and the US for six months. We wanted to assess the long-term safety of the product,"" Joshi said. ,When contacted, Dr Namita Chandhiok, deputy director, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said they had been looking for a product that can empower women. ""While last year was bad in terms of microbicides for HIV prevention, the government is now hoping that the second generation anti-retroviral drugs which are more specific can yield results."" ,""ICMR is planning more clinical trial sites to test more microbicides products,"" said Dr Badri Saxena, professor at the Centre for Policy and Research who hosted the workshop on regulatory pathways for microbicides in Asia, last week. ""The current use of HIV controlled methods such as abstinence, monogamy and condoms are not always feasible."" ,""Microbicides have been billed as a female-controlled HIV prevention method. Even though most women like the idea that they could use such a product without informing their partners, most would nevertheless prefer to tell their regular partners if they are using a microbicide,"" according to studies presented at the Microbicide 2006 conference. ""Some want to disclose the use of microbicides to enhance intimacy while others believe that gel-based lubricants would be detectable to their partners, triggering negative consequences."" ,Research indicates that a woman seeks her husband's approval before using a vaginal product and that male partners will not permit their wives to use a microbicide with an STI/HIV indication. ""Hence there is an urgent need to have other HIV prevention technologies which are women initiated methods,"" said Chandhiok.

Expressing its concern for the people living with HIV-AIDS, the Government said it will soon convene a meeting of all the stakeholders to work on the three-pronged strategy and assured the Supreme Court that soon ""neo-conventional"" methods would be adopted to deal with the disease and the stigma in society.,Stating this in the Supreme Court on Tuesday, which is seized of a petition seeking guidelines to deal with relief, care and rehabilitation of people with HIV/ AIDS, Additional Solicitor General Gopal Subramanium submitted: ""It's a matter of great importance. Any human life lost to it can't be merely treated with traditional affidavits but by neo-conventional methods."" ,While seeking some more time to be granted before further directions are issued, he claimed that the Government is eager to convene a meeting shortly for taking a three-pronged plan. ""The proposed approach would include steps to ensure adequate treatment to patients, finding out areas where there is insufficiency of ART centres and lastly, long term strategy with regard to rehabilitation of such patients,"" he told the apex court bench.,However at this, Justice R V Raveendran, who was part of the three-member bench headed by Chief Justice K G Balakrishnan said, ""but you should not wait for our orders."" ,Agreeing with the court's remark, ASG promptly assured it saying, ""We want to do it on the top priority. As these petitions are a chance for the Government to come out of the adversary mode and get all those concerned to adopt a comprehensive strategy."",Justice Raveedran, hearing the submissions sought to know, what does the Government plan to do about creating awareness about the deadly disease and its prevention? At this, the counsel assured that awareness would be at the forefront of all the measures to be adopted. ""Measures are also being taken to include information in the school curriculum."" ,Colin Gonsalves, who appeared for one of the petitioner organisations sought to highlight that how active steps are required from the Government. Citing the instance of states like Orissa, he said there's no CD4 machine (for testing the presence of HIV virus) in as many as 30 districts. Even in states like UP, in about 70 districts there were only three such machines with three ART centres working, he added.

Concerns over drug resistance have now forced a few researchers in Pune to conduct a study to find out whether new borns have become resistant to an anti-HIV medicine Nevirapine (NVP) given to them at the time of birth. The aim is to probe whether children who are infected with HIV at the time of birth would require a combination of anti-HIV medicines in the future to stay healthy. ,The study has been jointly proposed by B J Medical College (BJMC), Pune and John Hopkins University, US and sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, US. In fact, the BJMC has a Clinical Trial Unit (CTU) funded by NIH. ,Gowri Sastry, Coordinator of the Indo-US project on prevention of HIV transmission from mother to infant, said that the proposal for the new study has been submitted to the Indian Council of Medical Research. Presently, a single dose of nevirapine (NVP) remains the practical choice for prevention of HIV transmission from mother to child in areas with minimal medical resources. If no treatment is given, around 15-30 per cent of the babies born to HIV positive women could become infected with HIV during pregnancy and delivery. ,HIV infected pregnant women can take anti-HIV medicines during pregnancy or at the time of delivery to decrease the risk of passing the virus to the baby. Most HIV infected pregnant women take at least one dose of NVP just before or during delivery and the baby also gets one dose of NVP. But in some babies who take NVP or whose mothers take NVP, the HIV becomes resistant to NVP. This means that NVP may not work against HIV if it is taken in the future.

A former Army employee on Monday approached the Supreme Court against a Madhya Pradesh High Court judgment, which upheld the Army's order to dismiss him from service for being an HIV positive person.,The petitioner, while making the Union Government and the Army chief respondents, among others, claims that his services were terminated under Army Rule 13 on the grounds that he had contracted AIDS, consequently became blind and was unable to serve. The Madhya Pradesh High Court later dismissed a writ appeal filed by the petitioner. ,Challenging this, the petitioner says that ""while it may be true in many cases that the onset of AIDS would result in a person becoming physically unfit so as to perform his duties in the Army; the same is certainly not true for an HIV positive person. HIV positive persons serve in the US Army and in the armies of several European countries. Positive persons are also active sportsmen. The distinction between being HIV positive and having AIDS is one of progression and an HIV positive person can live a normal and physically active life for an indefinite period which has been lengthened due to the new drugs available in the market."",The petitioner further contended that the Army authorities took an excuse of the blindness which in fact was merely temporary and occurred due to the wrong treatment given to him at the Military Hospital, Jabalpur which was subsequently cured by the medical authorities at Command Hospital, Pune.  Moreover, the HC also failed to consider the report given by the AIDS Health Care Foundation where it was said that the tests, described in the medical sheet, were inconclusive of the diagnosis of Neurotuberculosis (an AIDS related ailment). ,The actual contraction of sexually transmitted diseases is not a military offence and cannot be punished as such. On being HIV positive alone would not entitle the army to discharge him, the petitioner argued.

The school has now started giving classes to 147 children who had to be forced to stop studies in regular schools after they were shunned and ostracised by society. ,The school, a unique attempt managed by corporation officials to root out the stigma against HIV infected children, has also admitted 28 children who either have no parents or have just one parent. Additional Municipal Commissioner Atul Patne, who took the initiative, said they decided to use the premises of a municipal school building in Nagpur's Indora area which had been shut down. ,But it was not that easy. ""I was told that I would be isolating the children from mainstream schools,"" said Patne, adding that the many of the NGOs, which are flush with funds, do little for raising the children with dignity. ""Children are being turned away from mainstream schools. Even if they are not, parents are unwilling to send them as they fear stigma and discrimination,"" said Patne. ,The Nagpur school is the first attempt by a civic body to shoulder the responsibility of educating children living with HIV. The children have been provided free text books and will get mid-day meals. The AMC now has plans to start schools in vulnerable pockets of Nagpur which have a sizable number of children living with HIV.

As the world observes another AIDS Day, the story of a child from the remote Perur hamlet in Tamil Nadu shows that the battle to create awareness and empathy about the disease has a long way to go. The boy had been crammed into a cloth bag and hung from a tree near the banks of the River Kaveripattinam in Krishnagiri district and left to die — by his father, say those involved in the case. The child was HIV positive.,Villagers found the child and put him under the care of doctors. His maternal grandmother Kanchana has come forward to accept him and is now taking care of him.,Witnesses and local officials told The Indian Express that on November 7, villagers of Kaveripattinam heard a feeble cry which led them, through thorny bushes, to find a child stuffed inside a shopping bag hung from a tree. They informed Dr Hari Ram of the local Community Health Centre, who reached the spot with a constable and a nurse.,""The child's condition was pathetic. He looked emaciated, so weak, his limbs were so thin. We thought at first he was a six-month-old baby. He was obviously undernourished and there were sores on his body and face,"" said Ram. ""We named him Siva and placed his age at one year."" (Later, it turned out the child was actually three years old.),After intensive life-support treatment, Ram handed over the child to Anand Ashram, a nodal agency for adoptions. But on November 12, the Ashram called him to say it was returning the child as he was HIV positive. Ram says he made frantic calls to several NGOs working in the HIV/AIDS field but none responded. Finally, his friend Vel Murugan contacted M Raja, the founder-president of the HIV Positive Society of Dharmapuri district, who had the child admitted to the government hospital there the same night.,Raja said the baby was diagnosed with tuberculosis — often associated with HIV infection — and was curled up so that his legs were almost around his neck.,""It was the most inhuman thing that anyone could do to such a child,"" he said.,Meanwhile, on Ram's complaint, police searched HIV positive couples who might have dumped their child. But their search was confined to Krishnagiri district and yielded no results. On November 14, however, 41-year-old Kanchana, living in faraway Perur, near Coimbatore, saw the picture of the child in a Tamil newspaper and recognised it for her grandchild.,She rushed to Dharmapuri, but Raja and baby's other caregivers were not ready to believe her initially.,After listening to her story, and going through official verification procedures, the authorities of the two districts were however convinced that Kanchana is the grandmother. The child is now with her.,Kanchana told The Indian Express the child was born to her younger daughter Yogambal and her husband Mani three years ago. Yogambal died 40 days after he was born, and Mani remarried.,Kanchana and her elder daughter looked after Yogambal's three children, including the youngest. Two years back, the two elder boys were handed over to Mani's father.,""About 10 months ago, when I had gone to Erode to attend a wedding, my elder daughter handed over the youngest child to his father Mani, who hails from Tirupur. When I came back, my daughter told me Mani had insisted on taking the child away. I suspect this was because he was worried I will demand a share in his family's wealth using the child as a pretext,"" said Kanchana. ""But when he found the child sick, he must have neglected him and then decided to get rid of him."" ""He was quite well with me. He is fine now,"" she says, trying to shush him. ""See, he's crying now and calling me awwa (grandmother in Telugu, their language)."",Said Raja, ""In Tamil Nadu HIV positive children are virtually tumbling out on to the streets. No one wants them, no one wants to adopt them.""

At a time when focus is on removing the stigma attached to AIDS, a school started here for HIV-positive children has run into controversy.,The school was started by Nagpur Municipal Corporation in association with newly launched NGO Sahara. However, local activists have opposed it, saying far from helping children integrate with the mainstream, the school will alienate them further. ,The controversy has already taken its toll, with enrollment down from 28 students to just six now, with many parents withdrawing their children. ,The idea of a separate school for HIV-positive children was mooted by Sahara, which approached local corporator Milind Mane of the RPI (Amedkar), who, in turn, took the proposal to the NMC. The idea was well received and at a function marking World Aids Day on December 1, NMC Additional Commissioner Atul Patne announced that the school will be started soon. ,Accordingly, on December 8, the school was opened with 28 children on the rolls. Within a few days, however, local activists started voicing their opposition, saying it amounted to segregating the children from the mainstream and worked against de-stigmatising them. ,Nitin Lata Waman, who runs an NGO called Yuwamukti Abhiyan, told The Indian Express that the idea was against human values. ""Not only is it against the law, but is socially disastrous too in the long run. These kids will now be easily identified as AIDS-affected and will be alienated further,"" said Waman. ,Mane, Sahara and some parents who have their children in the school, however, counter the activists' stand. ""Where were these people when these kids were facing discrimination within the so-called mainstream? Why did nobody think of doing something for them?"" asked Mane. ,He pointed out that the children belong to extremely poor families which can't fend for themselves, with parents of 50 per cent of the children being People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) and the other half being orphans. ""Everybody knows these children have AIDS. Their relatives don't care for them. Their parents have nowhere to go but to keep their kids off the mainstream due to the discriminatory treatment meted out by society. We also understand they should be part of the mainstream, but if that is not happening, should they continue to be deprived of their right to have a decent education and life?"" Mane asked.,Monika Fulmali (24), a mother of two boys, one of whom is on the school's rolls, is a supporter of the school. ""My husband and I can't do much work. We are very poor and can't bear the children's expenses. When I was in hospital for treatment, there was nobody to attend to me. I was segregated and was made to sleep on the floor and nobody cared for my kids then. Where were all those who are opposing the school?"" she said.,When contacted, NMC Additional Commissioner Atul Patne said: ""We have not started a separate school for HIV-positive kids. It's a school for children separated from the mainstream. Our school also has other students. This school isn't going to disclose the identity of the HIV-positive children. However, their identity has already been disclosed.""

""I want my win to show people everywhere that people with HIV/AIDS can not only lead long and normal lives, but can also become medal-winning sportspersons. It wasn't easy to reconcile with my fate, but it can't be changed. Can it? Being HIV+ is not the end of the world. There are medicines available, and some are even being distributed free by the Government."",Singh, who needs three doses of second line anti-retroviral drugs everyday, is now a beneficiary of the Government's free ART rollout. For the past six years he had been buying the expensive drugs on his own along with the costly dietary supplements for bodybuilding. ,""I don't have a job. I depend entirely on my parents and relatives for my sustenance. Their trust and understanding has now paid off,"" he explains. ,But his road to the podium wasn't that smooth. The local Eagle Guide Gym was short on equipment. Gym secretary Romesh Mayengbam says he even stole scrap iron to add to the gym's bars and weights. ""When Singh came here to train, we were aware of his status. Some members conveyed their apprehension to us privately. However, since I've worked with an anti-HIV/AIDS NGO earlier, I was able to allay their fears with scientifically proven facts. After that there were no problems."",Singh says he got the virus through syringes he used as a heroin addict several years ago. ""Now, I don't use drugs. My family and friends are my greatest and only source of support."" At last year's contest, Singh had to be satisfied with a silver, having fallen ill a week before the event. ,""I'm now planning to sign up for national-level competitions. Since I don't have a trainer, I've mostly learnt from consulting books and instruction manuals,"" he says. ,""The virus and I are challenging each other. But I've decided that I'll contest till I die. It's all about being focused.""

,
The year 2008 may well ring in some good news for around 2.5 million people living with HIV and AIDS in the country. Indian Railways is considering offering fare concessions, as high as 75 per cent, to HIV/AIDS patients travelling on its network. The move, quietly in the works at Rail Bhavan, is being regarded as one of Railway Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav's big-ticket ideas for the forthcoming Rail Budget in February.,While the original demand relates to offering fare concessions to HIV/AIDS patients in a bid to facilitate their travel to the National AIDS Control Organisation's (NACO) Antiretroviral Treatment (ATR) Centres offering treatment at subsidised rates at 127 locations across the country, Railways, it is reliably learnt, are mulling granting a blanket concession allowing HIV/AIDS patients to avail of the benefit whenever they travel on trains, irrespective of the purpose of their travel. ,""The demand to offer concessions in fare to HIV and AIDS patients has been there for the past couple of years with even the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) seeking the benefit for these people. However, it is for the first time that the Ministry has taken up the proposal and started working out the modalities,"" a senior railway official told The Indian Express. With the next Rail Budget expected to be UPA Government's last, officials said that the move, considering it's populist potential, is almost set to make it to Lalu's Rail Budget speech.,Indian Railways already offer fare concessions ranging between 50-75 per cent to people having a host of medical conditions. Those covered under the concessions being offered include orthopaedically handicapped, paraplegic, blind, mentally challenged, those suffering from hearing and speech disorders, patients suffering from cancer, tuberculosis, leprosy, thalassemia, heart and kidney disorders and ostomy patients. Except for a few categories, these concessions are made available to one escort per patient. ,A person suffering from cancer currently gets a 75 per cent fare concession while travelling in Second Class, Sleeper Class, First Class, AC Chair Car and AC 3-tier and a 50 per cent concession while travelling in AC 2-Tier and AC-1 Tier. Similarly, those suffering from TB or non-infectious leprosy get a flat 75 per cent concession, irrespective of the class of travel. Also, while those suffering from cancer, TB, leprosy and thalassemia are offered fare concessions only while travelling for treatment or periodic check-up, all the other categories are offered these concessions irrespective of their travel purposes.

An unusual scene unfolded in the crowded lobby of a government hospital in Madurai on Friday — 30-year-old Anjali (name changed) trying to sell her newborn. ,Anjali's husband, a HIV-positive construction coolie, died five months ago. She was infected too. On January 2, she delivered a baby girl. Two days later, a tearful Anjali, put up her baby for sale in the hospital lobby.,""I just wanted Rs 100 in return for my child. I wanted to buy some food and eat,"" she said, crying.,Hailing from Santhupettai village near Melur in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, Anjali had resisted help from the district's HIV Positive People's Welfare Society soon after her husband died as her neighbours had warned her against ""associating with such people."" She had already lost two babies during earlier deliveries.,S Anbalagan, president of the society, said: ""We knew her husband was HIV-positive and that she could have got infected too and offered to help. When she was four months pregnant we told her we could help her with abortion if she wished. But the neighbours abused and threatened us."",Last week, Anjali, who also works as a coolie on construction sites, was brought to the Madurai Government hospital by some co-workers, and admitted to the maternity ward. During the tests before admission it came out that she was HIV-positive too and was then placed in an isolated ward.,""Once her friends came to know she was HIV-positive, they just left and returned to their village,"" said Anbalagan.,Anjali delivered a baby girl on Wednesday. On Friday, ""giddy due to hunger,"" she tried to sell her baby to some visitors in the lobby.,""There's no one to help me. I had to go for various checks all by myself, carrying my baby. The ward staff kept abusing and cursing me. I was very hungry too,"" Anjali, told The Indian Express over phone from her hospital bed. She has now been admitted to a private hospital run by a Christian missionary in Thirunagar, about 10 kms from Madurai.,Dismissing allegations against the ward staff, Dr Mathivanan, Resident Medical Officer (RMO) of the Rajaji Hospital, said: ""We don't harass anyone. The allegations are not true."" He refused to reply to further questions on the issue.,While the DMK Government makes tall claims of providing various benefits including Rs 6,000 (given for pregnant women), Rs 400 (the monthly destitute women pension) and Rs 10,000 (given as funeral expenses when a breadwinner of a family dies), Anjali said she did not receive any help.,""This is the plight of destitute women across the state. Most of them are not even aware of government schemes for them. To add to the problem, government staff demand bribe to release these funds,"" said Anbalagan.

Recent studies show that women are susceptible to HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases in multiple ways. They are more likely to have been coerced into early sexual activity, face more sexual violence and are likely to have a greater number of sexual partners, cautions Pratima Murthy, Professor of Psychiatry and Chief of De-addiction Centre at National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bangalore. ,Women have a greater likelihood of selling sex for money or drugs and report significant reproductive health problems, says Murthy, who will present a paper on 'Women and Substance Abuse' at an International Conference on Opportunistic Pathogens in AIDS (ICOPA), to be held from January 27 to 29 at Delhi. ,Women using drugs often have partners who use drugs and their risky behaviour affects the women, Murthy adds. Similarly, non substance using women who have substance using partners are also vulnerable and form a bridge population for the spread of HIV/AIDS. Awareness on HIV risk is inadequate, accessibility to services is limited and this population is greatly undeserved.,While traditional use of drug continues, use of synthetic and semi-synthetic drugs has overtaken them. According to the national household survey, which evaluated 40,697 men between 12 and 60 years of age, prevalence of current substance use was as follows: tobacco 55.8 per cent, alcohol 21.4 per cent, opiates 0.7 per cent, sedative/hypnotics 0.1 per cent. ,A recent Rapid Assessment Survey of Drug Abuse evaluated 4,648 drug users across 14 cities in India. Women drug users in this study, numbering 371, constituted 8 per cent of the drug users studied. Average age of respondents was between 26 and 31 years. Age of initiation of substance use was between 16 and 22 years. A majority of the women interviewed (60-75 per cent) were single and had drug using friends. Alcohol was the commonest drug of initiation, in 60 to 90 per cent of respondents, followed by cannabis, in more than half. In Mumbai, nearly half the users had initiated drug use with heroin. In Hyderabad, more than one-third of respondents reported injecting drug use (IDU). Age at first sexual experience was between 18 and 20 years of age.

,

,

,
,


,
The AIDS virus has hideouts deep in the immune system that today's drugs cannot reach. Now scientists finally have discovered how HIV builds one of those fortresses — and they are exploring whether a drug already used to fight a parasite in developing countries just might hold a key to break in.,Researchers have long struggled unsuccessfully to attack what they call reservoirs of dormant HIV, and the new work is in very early stages.,But University of Rochester scientists say it may be fairly straightforward to attack one of these reservoirs, blood cells called macrophages that HIV hijacks and turns into viral hideaways. The new discovery shows the exact steps that HIV takes to do that — and found that some existing drugs, including a long-used treatment for leishmaniasis called miltefosine, can block the main step and thus cause these cells to self-destruct.,""It's a very smart virus,"" said lead researcher Dr Baek Kim. ""They have to have a very good fence to protect their house for a long time. Get rid of the fence, and now their house is gone."",Today's drugs have turned HIV from a quick death sentence into, for many, a chronic infection. Yet those drugs don't eliminate HIV because they can't reach the two known pools of cells where the virus can lie dormant, ever ready to resurface. , So-called memory T-cells form one such pool. As the name implies, these are the cells that ensure if you get, say, measles as a child, you're forever immune. They live for years, even decades, making them a logical HIV hideout, and one that scientists have repeatedly sought to dismantle to no avail.,Macrophages, another type of immune cell, form the second pool. They roam the body looking for invaders like bacteria to gobble up. If they get harmed, such as becoming infected by a virus, they are supposed to commit suicide. But HIV instead keeps them alive long past normal lifespan.,""Up to now, nobody has really thought about how to eliminate the macrophage reservoir,"" said Dr. Kuan-Teh Jeang, an HIV specialist at the National Institutes of Health. ""The imagination now has turned toward, 'How do we eliminate reservoirs?' The best way to address our problem is to simply kill those cells.""  The virus produces a protein that turns on a particular cell-survival pathway. After a multistep process, it ultimately activates an enzyme called Akt that in turn prevents cell suicide, the researchers reported Thursday online in the journal Retrovirology.

,

,
,


,
US Government scientists have discovered a new way that HIV attacks human cells, an advance that could provide fresh avenues for the development of additional therapies to stop AIDS, they reported on Sunday.,The discovery is the identification of a new human receptor for HIV. The receptor helps guide the virus to the gut after it gains entry to the body, where it begins its relentless attack on the immune system. ,The findings were reported online Sunday in the journal Nature Immunology by a team headed by Dr Anthony S Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.,For years, scientists have known that HIV rapidly invades the lymph nodes and lymph tissues that are abundant throughout the gut, or intestines. ,The gut becomes the prime site for replication of HIV, and the virus then goes on to deplete the lymph tissue of the key CD4 HIV-fighting immune cells.,That situation occurs in all HIV-infected individuals, however they may have acquired the infection. The findings appear to provide some, if not the main, answers to how and why that situation occurs. Dr Warner C. Greene, an AIDS expert and the director of the Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology here who was not involved in the research, said the findings were ""an important advance in the field.""

,
Even though India is among the nations having the highest number of AIDS cases in the world, very few women in its rural backyard go for an Elisa test during pregnancy to detect the deadly HIV virus. In fact, very few women are even aware of the existence of voluntary counselling and testing facilities, despite a Government policy to expand ante-natal HIV screening and prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV virus.,Approximately 60 per cent of the country's HIV cases occur in rural areas, and married women of childbearing age are considered a highly vulnerable population, who generally acquire the virus  primarily through their husbands' pre- and extramarital sexual behaviour.,According to a study conducted jointly by Institute of Health Management, Pachod, Maharashtra and John Hopkins School of Medicine, USA, awareness among rural women about HIV testing centres is extremely low.,The study was conducted among 60,000 individuals in Aurangabad district where at least one per cent of pregnant women have tested HIV positive in ante-natal clinic sentinnel surveillance sites. The nearest Government-sanctioned Voluntary Counselling Test Centre is located 50 kilometres away at the district hospital. Conducted between January and March 2006, around 400 pregnant women were questioned regarding HIV awareness, risk and history of antenatal HIV testing. ,While 87 per cent had heard of HIV virus, 84 per cent were aware of condoms while 72 per cent knew that consistent condom use is an effective way of preventing AIDS. Around 84 per cent knew that HIV can be sexually transmitted.,However, despite this knowledge of HIV, only 6 per cent of women in the study could correctly name an HIV testing facility. Furthermore, only 8 per cent reported receiving HIV counselling during pregnancy, and only 3 per cent of women had an HIV test done. However, one positive thing was that women in the current study had much better knowledge of HIV than women in the one conducted in 2001. Over the past several years, community and government efforts have increased rural women's HIV awareness, says Dr A Dayalchand, Director of IHMP. Still, two significant barriers exist, namely, lack of discussion by antenatal care providers about HIV and lack of awareness of HIV testing services, including VCT.  ,Few women could correctly name a HIV testing facility or reported awareness of VCT. Furthermore, only half of HIV test utilizers reported receiving associated counselling.

In a significant move, the Orissa Government has decided to provide monthly pension to HIV-positive persons under the state-sponsored 'Madhu Babu Pension Yojana' from this month, official sources have said.,Orissa is perhaps the first state to provide such monthly benefits to the HIV positive persons where  altogether 6,132 HIV-positive persons, irrespective of their age and earning condition, would benefit under the scheme in the first phase.,The maximum beneficiaries would be from Ganjam district where the number of the affected persons is also the highest.,Parameswar Swain, project director of the Orissa State AIDS Control Society, said under the scheme, every HIV-positive person detected would get Rs 200 per month. The Government had also decided to provide widow pension to the wife of the HIV-positive person on priority, he said. ,Swain has already provided the list of the affected persons to the district collectors to disburse the pension and the process of disbursement of the amount was under way. Though OSAC had detected 8,200 persons as HIV-positive by the end of December 2007, it has decided to provide pension to 6,132 persons in the first phase. ,""After verification and thorough scrutiny of the names, we have reached at 6,132 beneficiaries under the scheme in the first phase,"" he said. The beneficiaries' list would be revised in case of detection of new cases, he clarified.,While 2,527 affected persons, the highest in the state, would benefit under the scheme in Ganjam, followed by 350 in Koraput, 342 in Khurdha, 227 in Puri, 214 in Balasore, 211 in Rayagada, 170 in Angul, 166 in Jajpur and 165 in Kendrapara, there are just seven affected persons in Boudh district.

,

,

,
,


,
For the first time, researchers from Pune and the US have evidence showing that transmission of HIV from mother to infant through breast milk can be prevented with the drug, nevirapine. This is the same drug that helps prevent babies from getting the AIDS virus at birth. The researchers have claimed that an extended course of the antiretroviral drug, nevirapine (NVP), helps the breastfeeding babies of HIV-infected mothers to remain HIV-negative and live longer.,Estimates from the United Nations and the World Health Organization note that 150,000 infants acquire HIV infection through breastfeeding each year. Breastfeeding remains a leading route of HIV transmission in the developing world and the risk of acquiring HIV through breastfeeding is believed to be most during the earliest months of life.  Without treatment, 15-30 per cent of babies born to HIV positive women become infected with HIV during pregnancy and delivery. Another 5-20 per cent become infected through breastfeeding.,This is the first multinational clinical trial to show that pre-exposure antiretroviral prophylaxis can prevent mucosal transmission of HIV. The study is a feather in the cap for scientists from the B J Medical College in Pune, said  Dr J Sastry, project coordinator.,The  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases-sponsored clinical trials — conducted in Pune and known as  six week extended nevirapine (SWEN) studies — had sought to determine whether giving an extended daily regimen of nevirapine to breastfeeding babies of HIV-infected mothers would reduce the rates of HIV acquisition and death in these infants, as against the standard of care which is single dose NVP to mothers at labour and single dose to infants within 72 hours at birth, said Sastry. A course of NVP given daily to breastfeeding infants from days 8 to 42 cut the rate of HIV transmission via breastfeeding by almost half at six weeks, when compared with a single dose of NVP given to infants at birth — which is the current National AIDS Control Organisation policy of standard of care. The main aim of the study was to determine the rate of HIV transmission at six months. ,Investigators from B J Medical College, Johns Hopkins University, National AIDS Research Institute, Pune, and an international team of researchers enrolled 2,000 mother-infant pairs in three separate studies. These studies began in Ethiopia in 2001, in Pune in 2002, and Uganda in 2004. ,Project investigator raises doubt, In a significant development, principal investigator of the project Dr M A Phadke, who is now the Vice Chancellor of Maharashtra University of Health Sciences at Nashik, has said that she was unhappy with the way the study was being projected and that the drug could not bring about statistically significant change in the infants at the end of six months. ""Clearly, the main end point of the study was six months and not six weeks. The project that commenced in 2002 and ended in 2007 is a crucial  one,"" said Phadke. The main conclusion of the study was daily NVP from 8 to 42 days of life in breastfed infants of HIV positive mothers produced a significant change at six weeks, but not at the primary end point of six months which is the main end point of the study.  It did not produce statistically significant reduction in HIV transmission when compared with the single dose of nevirapine at the primary end point of six months. At six weeks of age, the drug produced statistically significant risk of HIV transmission by nearly half.  Phadke added that the drug given as a single dose for six weeks produced 38 per cent side effects of a severe nature. Prof R C Bollinger from Johns Hopkins University in the US was also the principal investigator for the project.

Nearly five million people are living with HIV in Asia with 4,40,000 people dying each year. If the spread of the virus continues in the current rate, an additional eight million people will become affected by 2020,"" according to a study on AIDS in Asia released in New York on Wednesday.,The independent study identified that in Asia, the virus is mainly spread by ""men who go for paid sex"". The number of such men is estimated to be around 75 million in Asia, and around 10 million women sell sex to these men.,According to the report, if Asian countries fail to mount a proper response, they will have to incur huge losses. This will mean that almost eight million adults and children in Asia-Pacific will be newly affected between 2008 and 2020. The annual death toll will increase to almost 5,00,000 by 2020. But if Asian leaders implement a programme to contain the disease right away, the number of newly affected can be kept at three million.,The death toll can be kept at less than 3,00,000 in 2020, saving the lives of more than 2,00,000 people each year. ""By spending between half a dollar and one dollar per capita, depending on the prevalence rate in the country, 80 per cent coverage of HIV prevention, treatment, care and livelihood security programmes can be achieved,"" the report has claimed.,The report, ""Redefining AIDS in Asia—Crafting an effective response"" outlined the recommendations for effective national responses to AIDS across Asia. ""High-impact interventions, such as HIV prevention programmes focused on key populations and antiretroviral treatment, should constitute the core of the HIV response across Asia,"" the report recommended.,The Commission believes that governments in Asia have the potential to make the ambitious international targets — 2001 Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS as well as Millennium Development Goal 6 to halt and reverse the epidemic by 2015 — a reality if they take the decisive steps set out in the report.,The report, however, acknowledged effective responses in India, Cambodia and Thailand but found a ""lack of urgency"" or coherence, not enough to curb the disease.

Patients with HIV and tuberculosis face a grave threat of malnourishment and anaemia if they do not adhere to a good diet, says a new study. The study is significant as it highlights the role of nutrition for people infected with HIV and TB, especially since multi-drug resistant TB is increasing and India—according to the WHO, the country has the most TB cases in the world.,Scientists from the Tuberculosis Research Centre (TRC) in Chennai, who studied the nutritional status of persons infected with HIV and TB have pointed out that malnutrition, anaemia, and hypoalbuminemia were most pronounced among HIV-positive patients with tuberculosis. In their study, published in the March 15 issue of the Clinical Infectious Diseases journal, TRC Deputy Director Dr Soumya Swaminathan and others, pointed out that HIV-positive individuals—including both those without TB and those treated for TB—had significantly lower body weight, body mass index (BMI), mid-arm, hip and waist circumference, compared with HIV-negative individuals from the same socioeconomic background. Among HIV-positive, TB-positive patients, 80-90 per cent remained underweight even after completion of anti-TB therapy.,Swaminathan said a total of 662 patients (488 HIV-positive, TB-negative patients and 174 HIV-positive, TB-positive patients who had completed anti-TB therapy and 160 HIV-negative control patients) were studied. In all three groups, the daily consumption of calories and proteins was below the recommended dietary allowance for Indian individuals of the same weight and activity type.,""There is limited data on the nutritional status of people living with HIV infection or AIDS, especially from the lower socio-economic strata in India,"" says Swaminathan. ""Our aim was to assess the nutritional status of HIV positive individuals and the impact of TB on various nutritional parameters, including body composition."" ,The results were shocking as approximately one-third of the HIV-positive, TB-negative group and one-half of the HIV-positive, TB-positive group had a BMI of 18.5, which defines clinically significant malnutrition for an adult.,Protein and fat consumption were lower among HIV-positive men than they were among HIV-negative men. For female patients, the body fat content was significantly lower in both of the HIV-positive groups, compared with the HIV-negative group. Fat content, was higher among women than it was among men in all groups. Haemoglobin level, serum albumin level, and total cholesterol level were each lower in the HIV-positive, TB-positive group than in the HIV-negative group for both sexes, whereas serum globulin level was significantly higher. Of note is the fact that the ""healthy"" HIV-negative individuals were also underweight and had caloric consumption well below the recommended limits.

,
In a promising new finding that could help anti-HIV therapy, researchers in the US have discovered how a genetic circuit in HIV controls whether the virus turns on or stays dormant.,Researchers at the University of California, San Diego, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory have also succeeded in forcing the virus towards dormancy. The authors say that their study shows how a developmental decision between HIV's two ""replication fates"" is made. The scientists were able to measure the level of ""noise"" or randomness in HIV gene expression and use this noise to probe how HIV decides to replicate or remain dormant. This method is somewhat like finding a radio station by honing in on regions with the most static. It provides a new tool for probing cellular, as well as viral, regulation, and for understanding  how other biological decisions are made, notably how stem cells choose between different developmental fates, the researchers say. The reserchers explored the genetic master circuit of HIV, the Tat circuit, and built upon previous work by Leor S. Weinberger, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC San Diego, which showed that it did not function like a standard on-off switch (a light switch, for example). Weinberger's previous work found that the HIV circuit is driven by cellular noise.

After Naxalism, Jharkhand has another battle on its hands: the HIV/AIDS epidemic. According to official figures, the state recorded 1,062 HIV positive cases in 2007 as against 287 in 2005 and 679 in 2006. In capital Ranchi, 566 persons were screened since January 1, 2007, and the number of full-blown AIDS cases has been officially put at eight. ,Experts say people who work as migrant labourers in other states are at high risk—a number of people from the state work as migrant labourers in cities such as Kolkata, Chennai and Mumbai.,Records show that 80 per cent of HIV positive persons are migrant labourers so the government's battle against the epidemic is concentrated in villages located along national highways in these districts. The Jharkhand AIDS Control Samiti (JACS) has set up a home for HIV/AIDS patients in Ranchi. The Ursuline Community Centre (UCC), an ancillary of the Catholic Church, is the first such centre in the state. All the 12 HIV positive residents at the centre are migrant labourers. Seven-year-old Bharti came to the centre when her parents Ganesh Manjhi and Rukmani Devi, both migrant labourers, died last year.,JACS has also set up AIDS detection laboratories in government hospitals in 15 of the 24 districts, including Ranchi, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Bokaro, Hazaribgh and Palamau. ,The Ursuline Community Centre has come as a blessing for people like 32-year-old Kartik Yadav. He had worried himself sick about how to take care of his family ever since all of them tested positive for HIV. But now, his family—wife Rukhi (30) and two sons Kundan (6) and Jai (2)—won't have to worry about food, lodging and medicine. ,The centre, which was set up last year with two HIV patients, now has 16 residents, including four children who are between two and six years old. The residents are grateful to Panjikaran Jacob and Sushila Bhengra who set up the center, which even has a play area for the children. Though another rehabilitation centre, Holy Cross, had come up in Hazaribagh, JACS began to back these homes after HIV spread its tentacles in Jharkhand in an alarming way.,

,
Scientists claim to have uncovered a new route for attacking HIV — they have blocked the viral infection in test tube by activating a human protein expressed in key immune cells.,Most of the drugs now used to fight HIV, which is the retrovirus that causes AIDS, target the virus' own proteins.,But those viral targets change quickly and lead to emergence of drug-resistant viral strains.,But the scientists found that when they interfered with a human protein called interleukin-2-inducible T cell kinase (ITK), they inhibited HIV infection of key human immune cells called T cells. ITK activates T cells as part of the body's healthy immune response. When HIV enters the body, it infects T cells and takes over the activities of these white blood cells so that the virus can replicate. Eventually, HIV infection compromises the immune system and causes AIDS.,But, according to the scientists, the new work shows that without active ITK protein, HIV cannot effectively take advantage of many signalling pathways within T cells, which in turn slows or blocks the spread of the virus.

,

,

,
,


,
Dog lovers have heard about Mudhol, an obscure town in Karnataka's Bagalkot district around 75 km from the Maharashtra border, because Britain's King George V christened two hunting dogs 'the hounds of Mudhol' after he received them as a gift from an erstwhile Mudhol ruler. But today, this town built around the sugarcane industry has other connections—with Bill Gates and former Karnataka Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy. A link that has been built around the high HIV prevalence rates in Mudhol and Bagalkot district in recent years.,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation indirectly supports an HIV/AIDS awareness scheme for the large number of sex workers in the region and former CM Kumaraswamy put Mudhol in the spotlight by spending a night at the home of an HIV-infected couple at Ingalagi village in Mudhol.,Social practices unique to the region like the dedication of young girls from poor families to sex work, in the guise of the 'devadasi' custom, have been responsible for the high HIV rates in the district of Bagalkot—often put down at 3.2 per cent of the population and as high as 2.3 per cent among women attending pregnancy clinics.,Despite the high HIV incidence or the Kumaraswamy stay, the issue of HIV and the rehabilitation of the 7,500-odd sex workers in the district does not figure on election agendas here.,After a break of a few years, the sugar factories in the region are buzzing again. Many that had shut have re-opened thanks to bumper cane production. Farmers displaced by the Almatti dam and compensated for it did much of the business in the region—from sex to supplies—until a few years ago. Today business is good in Mudhol—there are ATMs, cyber cafes and a highway that runs through the town.,Maharashtra chief minister Vilas Rao Deshmukh, who campaigned on Monday for the Congress candidate R.B. Thimmapur, a former MLA, spoke both in Hindi and Marathi. ""As soon as I saw Mudhol, I felt I was in Sholapur because of the trucks carrying sugarcane,"" he said.,Among key election issues in the constituency that is reserved for scheduled castes are the distribution of ration cards and provision of a dedicated power supply. Despite organising themselves into self-help groups, the sex workers of Bagalkot have not managed to get their problems addressed—like the admission of their children to hostels or loans that political parties make available to other women self-help groups.,""Initially, few women wanted to join from fear of being branded a sex worker. It took us a long while to convince them,"" says Madhu Naduvinamane, a 27-year-old peer coordinator who works for the sex workers.,Even in Ingalgi village of Mudhol, at the home of Shivanna Mahapathi, 32, and his wife Shubha Mahapathi, the HIV-infected farmer couple with whom former CM Kumaraswamy stayed, there is a feeling of being letdown.,""It is true that his stay provided HIV infected people greater acceptance in society. But it was also for his own publicity since he has not done anything for us or anyone else since staying here in January 2007. I asked for a job and travelled to Bangalore (600 km away) at least 10 times but nothing happened. Then, the government fell,"" says Shivanna.

An HIV positive couple and their two children were found dead at Prempara village in Visavadar taluka in Junagadh district on Thursday. ,Mansukh Patel (35) and his wife Dayaben (25) reportedly consumed toxic tablets (ammonium phosphate) and fed the same to their son Uttam (2) and daughter Komal (4).  ,According to Mansukh's elder brother Jayantibhai's statement before the police, Mansukh, a diamond cutter, had married Dayaben in court a few years ago. ,Both were diagnosed as being HIV positive a month ago. ,Mansukh apprised Jayantibhai about his condition and his wife's only a fortnight ago, and entreated him not to ""waste"" money on their treatment. ,Both were said to be under severe depression and had also become too weak to work. ,Owing to their condition, both Mansukh and Dayaben decided to kill themselves and also end the lives of their children, Jayantibhai reportedly told the police.,The Visavadar police recovered the bodies from a farmland and sent them for the post-mortem examination.,The bodies were cremated on Friday.

,
Despite all the care and safety measures adopted by blood banks, out of around 85,000 donors who between them accounted for 1 lakh units of blood collected in the city in 2007, at least 500 people were HIV positive. ,This was revealed in a study conducted from January to December last year by the Jan Kalyan chain of voluntary blood banks and medical services. The finding has underlined the need for standardisation and accreditation of services at not just blood banks but at nursing homes and tertiary hospitals as well.,According to Dr Dileep Wani, national president of the Jan Kalyan chain of voluntary blood banks and medical services and member of the State Blood Transfusion Council, despite asking people to give detailed and proper information about their high risk behaviour while donating blood, it is not being done. ,""We have a set of questions that ask the voluntary blood donor about their status — whether they have multiple partners or whether they are homosexuals. We expect basic honesty from people while answering these questions as at the time of collection of blood we cannot test the samples for their HIV status immediately,"" Wani said.,""They do not point out whether they engage in prostitution. This creates problems and despite all safety precautions, at least 500 people out of an approximate 85,000 who donated blood were found to be HIV positive,"" he said.,Now, for the first time,  the government has issued guidelines to tackle problems like these and has released a booklet for standardisation of blood banks and nursing homes in the country. In Pune, Symbiosis Institute of Health Sciences (SIHS) has been given the charge of sensitising nursing homes, dispensaries, hospitals and blood banks to adhere to the new guidelines.,""Even as there is no standardisation of patient care services, an attempt is being made for the first time all across the country to sensitise doctors and administration at hospitals,"" said SIHS Director Rajiv Yeravdekar. The Quality Council of India, through the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Health Care Organisations, has set up guidelines and released it in the form of a booklet Standards on blood banks/ blood centres/ transfusion services. Both Yeravdekar and Wani will conduct a workshop on July 27 to create awareness about the guidelines.

,

,

,
,


,
In a significant finding, scientists at the Pune-based National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) have, for the first time, found a novel 'recombinant' strain of the HIV virus in the North East region of the country. Not only does it resemble the strain from Thailand, but scientists have expressed caution that surveillance measures need to be taken for checking the emerging strains across the country. ,Presently the sub type C strain of the HIV virus is prevalent in the country. The HIV epidemic in the country has been primarily driven by sexual transmission and this finding now complicates the attempts towards defining intervention strategies, particularly in developing anti-AIDS vaccines. ,Scientists at NARI have documented in the journal AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses, published in the January and February 2008 issues, novel instances of B/C recombination in HIV-1 circulating in India where the origin of two subtypes, clade C and clade B differed and resembled a form that had established a foothold in Thailand. ,When contacted, Dr Ramesh Paranjape, Director of NARI, said that the emergence of the new strains could be due to cross-border migration and tourism. Further research will help us understand how effective this new combination of the B-C strain can be in transmitting the HIV virus from one individual to another, Paranjape told The Indian Express. ,Due to drug trafficking in the North-Eastern region which also has a high number of injecting drug users (IDUs), there is a strong possibility of the area being susceptible to emerging strains across the border, scientists point out. ,Dr Shrikant Tripathy, Deputy Director of NARI, said that if one person is infected with the Thai strain and also has the Indian strain of HIV, it is likely that that the two viruses can combine to form a recombinant or a hybrid strain. What is important now is to investigate how effective this strain can be in transmitting HIV from one individual to another, says Tripathy. ,Paranjape said four blood samples taken from HIV patients in Manipur were identified with the novel HIV-1 B/C recombinant strain. If this strain is found to be widely circulating in this geographical area, then one needs to investigate as to how this virus responds to HIV treatment. These circulating recombinant forms play a major role in the global AIDS epidemic.

Scientists in the United States believe they have uncovered the Achilles heel in the armour of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), a development that may be useful in the treatment and prevention of the infection that continues to kill millions around the world.,First reported in the early 1980s, 33 million people were living with AIDS in 2007, according to a report by the WHO and the UN.,Researchers led by Sudhir Paul at The University of the Texas Medical School, Houston, believe that they have found the weak spot, a tiny stretch of amino acids numbered 421-433 on gp120, which is now under study as a target for therapeutic intervention. ,""Unlike the changeable regions of its envelope, HIV erapeutic needs at least one region that must remain constant to attach to cells. If this region changes, HIV cannot infect cells,"" said Paul, who is lead author on a paper linked this theory in the June issue of the journal Autoimmunity Reviews.  ,Additional data on the theory are to be presented at the XVII International AIDS Conference from August 3-8 in Mexico City.,The team led by Paul has engineered antibodies with enzymatic activity, also known as abzymes, which can attack in the Achilles heel of the virus in a precise way, the Science Daily reported. ,""The abzymes recognise essentially all of the diverse HIV forms found across the world. This solves  the problem of HIV changeability. The next step is to confirm our theory in human clinical trials,"" Paul said. ,Steven J Norris of the Department of Pathology and firm our Laboratory Medicine at the University of Texas Medical School, said the work of Dr Paul's group is ""highly innovative"". ,""Their recent work indicates that naturally occurring catalytic antibodies, particularly those of the IgA subtype, may be useful in the treatment and prevention of HIV ubtype, infection,"" Norris stressed.

,
,


,
In what could be a precursor to future community-based health insurance schemes for the poor in India, the first ever group health insurance scheme for 248 people living with HIV in six districts of Karnataka was launched on Wednesday.,The group health insurance scheme will provide Rs 30,000 as health cover for HIV-infected people, including ,Rs 15,000 for hospitalisation at the onset of AIDS and Rs 15,000 for treatment.,The scheme was launched through the Karnataka Network of Positive People- a collective of people living with HIV, NGO Population Services International and the Star Health and Allied Insurance Company with the support of USAID. The Rs 1,500 premium for the Rs 30,000 insurance cover will be subsidised up to 50 per cent by the NGOs involved in the project.,National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) Director and Additional Secretary in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare K Sujatha Rao said the insurance scheme would address ""important needs of People Living with HIV (PLHIV)"". ""This will help them access timely care and live better lives. This is the first step in breaking down the financial barriers in accessing treatment for PLHIV,"" she said.,The insurance cover will help people with HIV and having CD4 counts at 300 or below to access cashless treatment in about 300 hospitals in Karnataka. The scheme has been introduced in the high HIV prevalence districts of Bellary, Mangalore, Udupi, Mysore, Bangalore and Kolar.,Hospitals have been informed about the insurance cover and have also been instructed not to turn away HIV- infected people, assistant vice president for Star Health and Allied Insurance C P Udayachandran said.,Though NACO itself is not directly involved in the scheme in Karnataka, the organisation has initiated a process of talking to the IRDA and major insurance players at the national level to evolve a national scheme for people living with HIV and their families, the NACO director said.,""We are trying to work on an insurance policy that will provide a package of services. We want to include even healthy people and families of those with HIV. A scheme for only the HIV infected would mean higher premiums,"" Sujatha Rao said.

The MNS's whipping up of sentiments against non-Marathis seems to be spreading its tentacles. An HIV-positive person, in hope of getting Anti Retroviral Treatment (ART) from a leading hospital in Mumbai, was recently given a cold shoulder and was refused treatment on the ground that it was available only to a Marathi. The patient who is counting his days has now approached the Supreme Court.,Drawing the attention of a three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice K G Balakrishnan, senior advocate Colin Gonsalves on Thursday sought an immediate intervention from the court, which sought response from the Centre and the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO). Issuing notices in this regard to the Health Ministry and NACO, the three-member bench posted the matter for further directions to September 29.,The senior counsel appearing for the patient, a native of Bihar, told the court that the state did not have the requisite drug and line of treatment for such patients. Coming to know of this, the HIV-infected person, whose name has been withheld, moved to Mumbai. But the city's JJ Hospital refused to treat him on the ground that he was not a Maharashtrian, the court was informed.,The apex court is already seized of a PIL filed by an NGO — Voluntary Health Organisation — seeking direction to make available ART facility to all. Gonsalves, who's the counsel for the NGO, brought the court's attention to the present case and pointed how despite court's directions, such discrimination is being followed, causing hardships to patients.

The Delhi High Court said that problem of HIV cannot be solved by curbing gay sex and pulled up the Centre for seeking the retention of penal provisions against homosexuality on this ground.,""Please show material, research paper or any document even from other country to show that decriminalisation (of gay sex) would lead to spread of HIV,"" a bench comprising Chief Justice A P Shah and Justice S Muralidhar observed when the government contended that homosexuality spreads the disease.,""If your argument is correct then spread of HIV should have stopped in the country as the law has been there for many years. But it is not the case as many people are dying of the dreaded disease, the court said.,The court objected to the contention of Additional Solicitor General P P Malhotra that the Home Ministry's affidavit, on which the government is relying, does not say any thing on this aspect.,""It's a strange situation. Your first affidavit (Home Ministry's) is silent. There is not a single word on what you are saying while other affidavit (Health Ministry's) is pointing out that the penal provision leads to marginalisation of HIV patients,"" the court said.,""How would the court decide the matter. Has there been any empirical study done by the government to substantiate its stand,"" the court said.,It said that a special law should be made to provide proper care and treatment to HIV patients like other countries.,""Unlike other countries we have not brought any special laws for people suffering from the disease on the pretext that penal provision under Indian Penal Code is sufficient,"" it said. ,Putting forward the Centre's view, the Additional Solicitor General said that gay sex is a threat to society and it could not be decriminalised.,""Right to health of few persons cannot supersede Right to health of society. There has to be balance between them and it is for this purpose that Section 377 is there,"" Malhotra said.,The court was hearing a PIL filed by gay rights activists seeking courts direction to amend Section 377 of Indian Penal Code by decriminalising gay sex among consenting adults in private.,The IPC at present holds an homosexual act as an offence and the Section provides a punishment of up to life imprisonment for indulging in such acts.,Earlier, gay rights activists had contended that the government, by decriminalising homosexual acts, is infringing upon their fundamental right to equality by decriminalising homosexual acts on the ground of morality.,""The Constitution gives fundamental right to equality and it prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex. But the rights of 25 lakh homosexuals in the country are being violated,"" they had contended on Thursday,The IPC at present holds homosexual act as an offence and the Section provides a punishment of up to life imprisonment for indulging in such acts.,""Moral argument cannot triumph over the constitutional rights in a democratic society where fundamental rights prohibit any discrimination on the ground of sex,"" the activists had said adding that gays in the country don't have full ""moral"" citizenship and they are being treated as second class citizens.

Germany's Harald zur Hausen and French researchers Francoise Barre-Sinoussi and Luc Montagnier shared the 2008 Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for discovering the AIDS virus and the role of viruses in cervical cancer.,Barre-Sinoussi and Montagnier were cited for their discovery of human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV; zur Hausen was cited for finding human papilloma viruses that cause cervical cancer, the second most common cancer among women.,The German scientist received half of the 10 million kronor prize, while the two French researchers shared the other half.,In its citation, the Nobel Assembly said Barre-Sinoussi and Montagnier's discovery was one prerequisite for the current understanding of the biology of AIDS and its antiretroviral treatment. The pair's work in the early 1980s made it possible to clone the HIV-1 genome.,""This has allowed identification of important details in its replication cycle and how the virus interacts with its host,"" the citation said. ""Furthermore, it led to development of methods to diagnose infected patients and to screen blood."",The assembly said zur Hausen ""went against current dogma"" when he found that oncogenic human papilloma virus, or HPV, caused cervical cancer, the second most common cancer among women.,""His discovery has led to characterisation of the natural history of HPV infection, an understanding of mechanisms of HPV-induced carcinogenesis and the development of prophylactic vaccines against HPV acquisition,"" the citation said. ,Alfred Nobel, the Swede who invented dynamite, established the prizes in his will in the categories of medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and peace. The economics prize is technically not a Nobel, but a 1968 creation of Sweden's central bank.

A matron deputed at Tihar Jail was admitted to hospital after being bitten by a Nigerian woman inmate last week. The inmate is HIV-positive.  ,According to sources, the incident occurred around 6.45 pm on Saturday when matron Renu Yadav asked the inmate (identity withheld) to take her medicine.

It took around five minutes and over a dozen other women jail staff to overpower the Nigerian inmate. ,""While staff members tried to restrain her, she lunged forward to attack Yadav,"" a Tihar Jail official said. ,The inmate was brought to jail a few months ago in connection with a case under the Narcotics Drug and Psychotropic Substances Act and was under treatment as she is HIV-positive.,""She would often lose her temper without any reason and on Saturday crossed limits,"" said a senior Tihar Jail official. Sources said Yadav was immediately taken to a doctor and is admitted at Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital. ,""She is under constant supervision of doctors at the hospital,"" a source in the jail said.

Doctors who refuse to treat HIV/ AIDS patients will be sternly dealt with, the Centre told the Supreme Court on Wednesday. However, during the hearing on a PIL related to the matter, the court observed that the Government is not doing enough to improve the public healthcare system.,During the hearing of a PIL highlighting apathetic treatment and lack of facilities for HIV/ AIDS patients across the country, the three-member Bench, headed by Chief Justice K G Balakrishnan, on Wednesday remarked, ""In rural India, there are hardly any doctors. Even in a 50-bed hospital not a single doctor is available. It's only on paper."",As Additional Solicitor General Gopal Subramanium informed the court that the Government has recently asked all the state governments to improve healthcare facilities, and that primary health centres were working satisfactorily in rural areas of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, the court shot back, ""Go and check in any government hospital in Delhi, Bihar and UP."",Trying to convince the Bench about the 'remedial' measures taken at the highest level to deal with instances of refusal to persons living with HIV/ AIDS (PLHA) or non-availability of basic medicines or treatment for them, the Government counsel said all the states have been asked to implement the office memorandum sent to them recently. According to the office memorandum, ""All doctors, nurses and hospital staff, whether in the public or private sector shall treat PLHAs in a professional and humane manner, treating them always with dignity and care. No doctor or nurse shall refuse to treat a PLHA on account of his/her positive status. In treating a PLHA there shall be no discrimination or stigma whatsoever."" It also suggested taking stringent steps against any doctor who refuses to treat any HIV/ AIDS patient. ,""The cases of denial of services to positive patients should be viewed seriously and action initiated in all such cases,"" stated the memorandum, placed before the court. The Centre said private doctors have been directed to make themselves acquainted with National AIDS Control Organisation's (NACO) protocols and policies with regard to the care and treatment, which are available on NACO's website.,The Bench, also comprising Justices Ashok Bhan and P Sathasivam, directed all states to furnish their response to the office memorandum within four weeks.

,

,
,


,
,,Approximately 600 HIV-positive patients at the state-run J J Hospital and many others in the Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) treatment centres in the country are currently developing toxicity due to the treatment. Recognising this as a grave problem, National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) under its revised national guidelines has recently revised the drug regimen by introducing alternate first line treatment.  ,According to NACO, currently there are about 177 ART centres providing first line treatment to over 1.5 lakh patients. Due to the long duration of the treatment, the patients are increasingly experiencing various complications because of ART drugs. However, the doctors say that toxicity in this case does not lead to mortality. The data and information in this regard was presented at the ongoing conference on Fundamental and Transnational Research on HIV and AIDS. ,""Increasingly, toxicity of ART is becoming an important issue in the management of patients with HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus). The first line ART treatment has improved the CD4 count (used to assess a person's immune system) and has decreased the incidence of opportunistic infection. But with continued use, the complications of treatment are being seen in an increased frequency in most of the ART centres in the country,"" said Dr Alaka Deshpande, in-charge of the ART centre at the J J Hospital which is the largest in the country. ""Despite toxicity, permanent and good adherence to the therapy is needed to maximize its long-term benefits,"" Dr Deshpande added.,According to doctors, approximately 10 per cent of patients on the first line of ART treatment are developing toxicity. Although adverse reactions to the therapy are common, and profoundly affect its clinical efficacy by limiting adherence, many such reactions are poorly studied and analysed, and are under-reported, say doctors.,""Toxicity in form of facial disfigurement, buffalo hump due to maldistribution of fat, breast hypertrophy (large breast) in men, thinner limbs, sunken chic, loss of mass on the buttock and protruding belly, peripheral neuropathy (tingling numbness in the limb and burning pain in the feet), is mainly caused due to a drug — Stavudine— introduced in the first line of treatment. Doctors treating HIV patients had no option but to give Stavudine as Zidovudi—  alternative drug available in the first line of treatment causes sever anemia. Indian HIV patients anyways have low hemoglobin and are anemic, hence doctors did not have any option but to bank on Stavudine,"" said Dr Deshpande. ,However, NACO last month introduced a new drug in the ART regimen called Tenofovir. ,""The drug is expensive but is provided free of cost at the J J Hospital currently and will be provided at selected centres all over the country. Only if other two drugs fail to work, Tenofovir will be used in the form of combination therapy,"" said Dr Deshpande. ,In countries like the US and the UK, Tenofovir is used as the first line drug to treat HIV patients due to the toxicity of the other two drugs. ""Zedovudine, least expensive drug, was given accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1987 and Stavudine in 1995. After the continued use, the long term complications are becoming apparent of late. Therefore in the West, they have switched to Tenofovir. India too will slowly shift to the less toxic drug as increased morbidity, escalating cost of management and increased stigmatisation is becoming a new challenge,"" said Dr Deshpande. The J J Hospital has so far treated 15 patients with Tenofovir.

Looking at the high incidence of tuberculosis among HIV-positive patients, the state is upgrading its infrastructure to handle dual cases of TB and HIV-AIDS. With this will come up the state's first ever multi-drug resistant laboratory (MDRL) at Dharampur in Solan district, which would handle severe cases of tuberculosis that so far had to be referred to Delhi due to lack of testing facilities within the state for such patients who stopped responding to the treatment. The laboratory is in the pipeline since 2006. ,Experts say severe cases of TB are also seen in many patients who are HIV positive and in such cases the mode of treatment has to be more intense than the regular direct observation treatment scheme (DOTS), in which the new laboratory would be helpful.,An integrated counselling and testing centre (ICTC) would come up alongside MDRL so that HIV-AIDS patients can get testing, treatment and counselling for tuberculosis under the ,same roof. ,The state's proposal has been confirmed as accepted by the Director General for tuberculosis programme in the Central Health Ministry and the laboratory would start functioning at the State Training and Demonstration Centre-cum-Sanitarium at Dharampur by January, while the partial facilities would be available to patients later this month. ,A similar facility would be set up at Dr Rajender Prasad Medical College in Tanda, said Director, Health Services, Dr Sulakshna Puri. ,""The existing sanitarium at Dharampur would be upgraded as per the needs of the patients under dual attack of TB and HIV. Earlier, test reports for such patients had to be sent outside the state to Delhi and Ahmedabad and reports took over three months to be processed,"" said Puri.,Research has shown that the 60 per cent of the patients infected with HIV are also susceptible to tuberculosis. The arrangement for cross-referral centres was the need of the hour as timely detection of TB in HIV and AIDS patients improves quality of their life and gives them comparative longevity, said Dr Puri.

,

,

,
,
,

,
The rate of HIV infection among people who inject themselves with drugs appears to be rising, according to a study published on Wednesday.,An estimated 3 million self-injecting drug users worldwide may be HIV positive, said the analysis of peer-reviewed studies and data from United Nations agencies and international experts.,It identified injected drug use in 148 countries and found HIV infections among these kind of users topped 40 percent in nine nations: Estonia, Ukraine, Myanmar (Burma), Indonesia, Thailand, Nepal, Argentina, Brazil and Kenya.,""The new data do suggest increases in both the number of injecting drug users and the prevalence of HIV in users,"" Kamyar Arasteh and Don Des Jarlais of Beth Israel Medical Center in New York wrote in a commentary about the study published in the medical journal Lancet.,They said there may be time to educate people in countries where injecting drug use is common but the virus has not yet begun infecting users to a large degree.,Used syringes can spread HIV. Infected drug users are also more likely to engage in risky behaviobehaviorur such as unprotected sex that can spread the virus that causes AIDS.,The researchers estimated that in 2007 nearly 16 million people around the world injected drugs, with China, the United States and Russia having the largest number of such users.,They also noted there was little data from places in Africa but said Southeast Asia, eastern Europe, and Latin America were areas of worry.,GLOBAL CHALLENGE,""Injecting drug use occurs in most countries and HIV infection is prevalent among many populations of injecting drug users, representing a major challenge to global health,"" Bradley Mathers of the National Drug and Alcohol Research Center in Australia and colleagues wrote.,The review showed big differences worldwide. For example, in Britain 0.4 percent of people aged 15 to 64 injected drugs, with 2.3 percent of them estimated to be HIV positive.,In Spain the proportion of addicts is lower at 0.31 percent but nearly 40 percent of them have HIV, the highest proportion in Europe, the researchers said.,Australia and New Zealand have maintained a very low level of HIV infection even though they have more injected drug users, something the researchers attributed to swift introduction of needle and syringe exchange programs in the 1980s.,They also cited Estonia as a country representative of the quick spread of HIV infections among drug users in recent years.,""A decade ago HIV was not identified among people who inject drugs in Estonia,"" the researchers said. ""A more recent estimate now suggests that the prevalence of HIV infection in some populations has reached 72 percent in one sample of injecting drug users.""

Widowed at 30, HIV positive Chhaya Tope had resigned herself to a life of loneliness, but a website for Indians afflicted with AIDS has given her another chance at love.,Tope lost her husband to AIDS. Six months ago, desperation drove her to post her profile on www.positivesaathi.com, and she has since been in regular contact with an HIV positive Indian man living in Canada, and they plan on getting married next month.,""When I got to know that my husband had transmitted the disease to me I was angry and bitter. I thought my life was over and even attempted suicide,"" Tope said.,""But my fiance is such a caring person. Since he is HIV positive himself he understands my situation. We are getting married next month, thanks to the website that made it possible."",Since its launch in 2007, around 460 men and women have registered their profiles on the site, and several have found partners who are willing to settle down with them.,The website's founder, government employee Anil Kumar Valiv, said he had no way of knowing how many marriages his service had created, but added that he was happy to help HIV/AIDS sufferers, who are stigmatised in society.,,Valiv said before he started positivesaathi.com, no other mainstream Indian matrimonial website catered exclusively to HIV positive people. Prominent marriage portals such as www.bharatmatrimony.com and www.jeevansaathi.com said they did not have a separate search criteria for people living with HIV/AIDS.,Valiv lost a close friend to AIDS and it was this friend's desire for a relatively normal life that inspired the website.,""In India it is very difficult to find a life partner for an HIV positive person. Internet provides the necessary anonymity to people who prefer to register without disclosing their real names,"" he said.,India is home to the world's third largest caseload of HIV/AIDS, and the eagerness of the website's users for a chance at normality shows in their profile descriptions. Female registration is low -- for every 100 male entries, there are only about 10 female entries -- but users still hold out hope.,""I am looking for my life partner as early as possible. Because my parents have no idea about my position. They want to see my marriage,"" user 'krishnaiah' wrote on his profile.,A 28-year-old woman who registered under 'sssss' said: ""I was full of desire to be successful in my life, but it was my destiny to register in this site. I will strive to survive."",The site also hosts basic information about HIV/AIDS including helpline numbers and addresses of NGOs.,Valiv concedes that the number of users on his site is too small to represent the thousands searching for partners in India, where millions of people do not have access to the Internet or are unable to use a computer.,But he added that such niche portals could help prevent the spread of the disease in a country where being single is usually frowned upon and parents often arrange matches for children.,""Often parents give in to social pressure and knowingly marry off sons with HIV infection to healthy women who in turn get infected,"" he said.,""Exclusive marriage portals for HIV positive people will at least give these people the freedom to choose their own life partners and save many innocent lives,"" said Valiv.

Rebuffed by his family and the government, the past six months have been a struggle for acceptance and survival for 18-year-old Narendra Dhobi, a fisherman from Omar Gaun in Valsad district. Life turned for the worse since Dhobi was detected HIV positive in a Pakistani jail in Karachi. When sent back, his family showed him the door and the state government turned down all his pleas for seeking rehabilitation and medication. ,Dhobi was arrested by the Pakistan Maritime Security Agency (PMSA) along with other fishermen in January 2008. A health check up by the Karachi Jail authorities, which confirmed his HIV positive status, was only the beginning of a tough time ahead for him.,In April 2008, after the HIV test, the Pakistani authorities sent him back on humanitarian grounds. ,But as Dhobi said, home coming has been sadder. ""My family did not accept me and the government refused to provide any help,"" he said.,He moved from pillar to post, from the AIDS control agencies to the Health Department officials and even Minister Jay Narayan Vyas for support, but in vain. ,Let alone medical support, Dhobi is still awaiting the compensation he is entitled to from the state government, which is given to every fishermen lodged in a Pakistani jail.,""The Fisheries Department pays Rs 50 per day compensation to fishermen lodged in Pakistani jails. Even after six months, I am awaiting the amount due to me,"" he said.,He added: ""I have been supported by the NGO 'People Living with HIV positive' in Surat. They have sponsored my treatment at Reliance Hospital in Surat. I want to go home and I want the government to support me to start a new life. I have no job and money to get the medication."" ,H Dave, Deputy Commissioner, state Fisheries Department said the compensation release in the case of Dhobi has got delayed due to technical reasons. ""He declared Maharashtra as his native place in the registration form submitted to the Fisheries Department, but he belongs to Valsad in south Gujarat."",The official added that formalities have been completed and Dhobi will soon receive an amount of over Rs 6,000 from the Fisheries Department.,Meanwhile, Vyas told Newsline that he will look into the matter. ""We will get the case details. The state government is willing to extend all possible help to anyone in distress,"" he said.

The sessions court on Monday acquitted a man charged with killing his wife who was HIV positive.,Dayashankar Vishwakarma (27), was acquitted on Monday after the prosecution failed to prove its theory of supari killing (contract killing), and could not provide with circumstantial evidence to nail the accused. ,According to the police, the victim was married to Vishwakarma's first cousin, and after his death got married to the accused. ,The prosecution argued that it was during victim's first marriage that she got infected with HIV. ,However, soon after Vishwakarma found out that his wife was HIV positive, he planned to kill her, said the prosecution. The police in the case had mentioned a person named Raju Kanya, who had taken a loan of Rs 15,000 from Vishwakarma. In lieu of the loan, Kanya agreed to kill Vishwakarma's wife, said the prosecution. ,On June 17, 2007 while Kajal and her four-year-old son were at home, Kanya allegedly strangled her to death with a wire. The neighbours were alerted when the child started crying and immediately informed the police. Though Kanya fled the scene, Vishwakarma was arrested later. ""Only seven witnesses were examined in the court. Prosecution did not summon the prime witness, who was believed to have overheard Vishwakarma's plan to kill his wife,"" said defence advocate Jayesh Vithlani. ,Defence had earlier argued that Vishwakarma was not in Mumbai on the day of the murder. Judge R U Deshmukh thus acquitted Vishwakarma of all charges, while Kanya still is an absconding accused.

HIV-positive patients under treatment who are showing signs of stability, can cut their mandatory travels to Pune from far flung places, with five new link antiretroviral treatment (ART) centres set to come up at Baramati, Manchar, Wadgao Maval, Indapur and Bhor. ,Patients responding well to treatment can avail themselves of drugs from the link ART centres to be set up soon. ,""We are already shifting drugs to these centres and have trained counsellors and medical officers,"" officials at the ART centre of Sassoon General Hospital said. This is part of the plan to have 36 link ART centres across the state, said Dr Rekha Jain, National AIDS Control Organisation's Western region coordinator. ,Pune's first ART centre was set up at Sassoon General Hospital four years back and while 16,000 patients enrolled for medication, 6,000 were eligible for drugs. Later, as other ART centres were set up at Ahmednagar, Satara and other places, the load on Sassoon was reduced. At present, only 4,100 patients are on antiretroviral treatment here. ,Now, a patient from Baramati will no longer need to visit Sassoon every month for the drugs as the link centre at the tehsil will ensure the supply. This facility will be useful for patients who have responded well to months of treatment and need not visit Sassoon for a check up. Similar link centres are being set up around Sangli, Mumbai and other places where the ART centres were initially set up, Jain said. ,The initiative will go beyond the link ART centres as plans are on to set up centres in each district. ,In Maharashtra, 1.2 lakh people are on antiretroviral treatment and 43,000 get the drugs. The government has a budget of Rs 40-50 crore for setting up these centres, complete with drugs and trained manpower. A camp will be held on November 6-7 in Mumbai to train medical officers before rolling out the plan.

,
Two years after the government urged that HIV tests become as common as cholesterol checks, there are small gains but still one in five people infected with the AIDS virus do not know it, scientists said.,Eleven states that once required special consent for HIV testing have changed their laws, a key step to making an HIV test part of the standard battery that patients expect.,But HIV specialists meeting on Thursday said other barriers include physician confusion about the ease of today's rapid tests, which can cost as little as USD15, even though many patients seem to accept them.,No more than 100 of the nation's 5,000 emergency rooms routinely test for HIV in patients who are not critically ill, said John Bartlett of Johns Hopkins University, who co-chaired the Forum for Collaborative HIV Research meeting. Yet because so many HIV patients are poor or uninsured, ERs are the health care setting most likely to find them.,And while every pregnant woman is supposed to be tested so her foetus can be protected if the mother is found to have AIDS, about 40 per cent are not tested, he said.,""Those are what we call missed opportunities,"" Bartlett said.,Today, the test is ""much better, it's much easier, it's much cheaper. The treatment is really great now."",Just over 1.1 million Americans are estimated to have HIV and 232,000 do not know it, according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.,The CDC for years recommended routine testing mainly for people at high-risk, such as injecting drug users. Then, finally, came drugs potent enough to keep HIV patients healthy for years, postponing the slide into full-blown AIDS. Yet nearly half of new infections still were being discovered too late for patients to benefit. Not to mention that people who don't know they're infected unwittingly spread the virus.

There is a declining trend in the prevalence of HIV infection among high-risk groups, Dr Prakash Sabade, project director of  Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) said here on Wednesday. ,The epidemic had stabilised but this did not mean that we should be complacent, Sabade said. He along with officials of the Geneva-based Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM) was in the city to review the ongoing HIV prevention projects funded by them. ,Dr Suresh Gupta, additional director, MSACS, said that 'prevention of HIV' programmes had reached a saturation point among high-risk groups. So much so that from 88 HIV testing facilities in 2005, the state has set up a total of 678 HIV testing facilities. Also a total of 124 public and private partnership programmes are underway in the state to upscale efforts to prevent HIV. ,The government has a budget of Rs 62 crore for HIV awareness and intervention programmes in the state. ,The funds are provided by the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) and given to 33 NGOs in the state. According to MSACS officials there is a general decline of HIV among high-risk groups from 30 per cent to 14 per cent. ,Sabade, however, emphasised that it was not the time to be complacent. Reiterating this viewpoint, Rekha Jain, western region coordinator of NACO for Maharashtra and Goa, said that a total of 36 link antiretroviral treatment centres are being set up in the state. Here people who have stabilised on treatment for HIV after six months or so need not travel to far-flung centres for their medication.  In Maharashtra, a total of 1.2 lakh persons suffering from HIV have enrolled in the ART programme and around 43,000 are on treatment.

Manju Kamble possibly did not realise the significance of the visit she was being paid on Thursday afternoon. She shyly offered tea and water to the third richest man in the world and then settled herself at the window of her kitchen. When her visitor left after spending ten minutes at her one-room home, she waved goodbye.,Manju Kamble (40) has been a sex worker for years. Her visitor was Bill Gates, Microsoft founder, who was in Pune on Thursday. Among the questions Gates asked her was, ""How many clients do you get everyday? Do you use condoms?"",Manju and her housemates had a few clients a day, a translator informed Gates, assuring him about the use of condoms. Each client pays us Rs 60 or Rs 70, said Gauri (name changed), who like Manju has sent her two children to a village in Karnataka. Business is not always good, the women grumbled, sometimes as low as one or two clients a day.,Gates is carrying out a crusade against HIV. He was on a ""personal learning visit"" planned by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.,It was a tightly packed schedule, with television and newspaper journalists turning up in huge numbers and occupying vantage positions at different locations for a photo-op and some sound byte.,For Gates, however, it was a purely personal visit that was not to be affected by the huge media presence. His guards ensured that Gates, his father and two sisters were not shoved and pushed by the huge crowd that surrounded the two Mercedez Benz cars that pulled into the narrow lanes of Budhwar Peth, where Gates interacted with the commercial sex workers at Manju Kamble's house.,Gates and his family also visited the Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) project of Vanchit Vikas, a clinic funded by the foundation, on his hour-long visit to Budhwar Peth. According to Darshana Vyas, project director of Pathfinder International, an NGO whose 'Mukta' project works in ten districts in the state to reduce the prevalence of STIs, Gates seemed to be happy with the work at the clinic.,Meena Kurlekar, director of the Vanchit Vikas project, said that the foundation has provided funds for the last three years and helped them reach out to over 4,000 commercial sex workers. ""We have 35 to 40 women visiting our clinic daily and the level of STI infection has considerably reduced among them,"" Kurlekar said. ,Gates refused to answer queries by The Indian Express. A press release stated that Bill Gates and his family were on a personal visit to India and though they may visit foundation grantees and other partners, they would not provide details about their plans.

,

,

,
,
,

,
The United Nations on Monday urged countries across the world to expand screening of newborn infants exposed to the virus that causes AIDS, saying it could save the lives of countless children.,""Without appropriate treatment, half of children with HIV will die from an HIV-related cause by their second birthday,"" Ann Veneman, executive director of the UN children's fund UNICEF, said about a new UN AIDS report launched in New York on the 20th World AIDS Day.,""Survival rates are up to 75 percent higher for HIV-positive newborns who are diagnosed and begin treatment within their first 12 weeks,"" she said in a statement.,The report said there was visible progress in the fight against AIDS – some 3 million people worldwide are currently receiving treatment and the number of new infections and AIDS deaths has dropped. But negative trends remain.,The report – prepared by UNICEF, the UN AIDS program UNAIDS, the World Health Organization, and the UN Population Fund – warned that pregnant women were not receiving sufficient counselling and other services necessary to teach them about contraception and safer infant feeding.,It said many children less than a year old were dying of AIDS-related illnesses before they are even tested for HIV.,But there are ways of dealing with infants that have the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS.,The report cited the example of South Africa, where babies born to HIV-positive mothers were being tested for HIV at six weeks of age. Many of those who test positive receive anti-retroviral treatment, it said.,""A recent study found increased survival rates among infants who were provided with antiretroviral therapy as soon as they were diagnosed with HIV,"" the report said.,CHALLENGES,It said early infant testing was being expanded in other countries hit hard by AIDS, including Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Swaziland and Zambia.,The report also recommends increased access to tests assessing immune functions of HIV-positive mothers to determine their stage of HIV infection.,This will help them make decisions about their own health and treatment needs and reduce the chance of the virus being passed to their babies.,There are other challenges in the fight against AIDS. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said it was important to continue to fund efforts to eradicate the disease, despite the global financial turmoil.,""We have to maintain this momentum, especially during the time of financial crisis,"" Ban said at a conference on the crisis in Doha. ""Funding shortages could take a deadly toll."",Separately, the United Nations said it has appointed Michel Sidibe of Mali as the new head of UNAIDS. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria said French first lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy has agreed to serve as an ambassador for the protection of mothers and children against AIDS.,HIV has infected some 33 million people worldwide – 22 million in sub-Saharan Africa alone – and AIDS now ranks among the world's top 10 killer diseases. An estimated 25 million people have died of the incurable condition, the No1 killer in Africa.

Prevention is the only cure for AIDS but the spread of HIV from mother to child can be checked by administering a dose of Nevirapine at the onset of labour and later to the newborn child, say experts.,""Recently, we had a HIV positive pregnant woman at the civil hospital. She was given a dose of the medicine and her child was born without any traces of the virus,"" said Dr Jasbir Singh, incharge of Integrated Coordination and Testing Centre (ICTC) at the Civil Hospital.,""But sadly, there is still very less awareness about AIDS and this medicine among patients as well as doctors. If the medicine is administered to a pregnant woman, the risk of transmission reduces to a negligible level. In fact, there is a 91 per cent chance that the child will be completely safe. Otherwise, the odds of the virus being transmitted to the child are 35 per cent,"" said Singh.,He said in certain cases, the newborn may test positive for HIV in the first few months after birth as he/she carries the anti-bodies of the mother. ""But soon, the tests start showing negative,"" he added.,Dr Chanchal Jaggi, an ayurvedic medical officer posted at Mullanpur and an active member of the Red Ribbon Express team, reiterates Singh's advice. ""The only way to ensure that the virus is not transferred to the newborn is to give a single dose of Nevirapine to the HIV positive mother. Within 48 to 72 hours of birth, the newborn should also be given oral suspension of Nevirapine (in the form of syrup) as per his/her body weight,"" he said.,Year   patients at ICTC,2003                                   17,2004                                 24,2005                                 41,2006                                 51,2007                              141,According to the report of the 2005 Sentinel Surveillance, Ludhiana district has the highest number of AIDS/HIV-positive patients.

The ever-increasing cases of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and a subsequent rise in the number of patients coming with eye-related ailments has made ophthalmologists feel the need for introducing a protocol for mandatory HIV test.,Till a year ago, the Western Regional Centre of Ophthalmology at the civil hospital, on an average, received two cases of HIV positive people with eye ailments every week. The number has now shot up to five every week. ,Deepak Mehta, Dean, M&J Institute and Western Regional Centre of Ophthalmology, said: ""While some pre-diagnosed patients come here, we do conduct HIV tests in suspected cases. A need is being felt for making the tests mandatory for all surgeries like keratoplasty."",While the diagnosis saves a patient from further complexities, its absence exposes doctors to a risk of contracting the virus, he added.,As the immunity level in the HIV positive people goes down significantly, they are susceptible to a number of opportunistic infections (OIs) like retinitis and others that may lead to the loss of vision. Such patients are prone to infections, as generally they are brought for treatment at a later stage.

Justifying criminalisation of homosexuality in the country, the Centre has pleaded before the Delhi High Court that it is one of the main reasons for spread of HIV/AIDS and needs to be curbed.,In a written submission filed by Additional Solicitor General P P Malhotra, the Centre said that legalising Men having sex with Men (MSM), as pleaded by gay rights activists, would lead to spread of the dreaded disease and placed reports of various countries to substantiate its stand.,""In Zambia, one in three (33 per cent) surveyed men who have sex with men tested HIV-positive. In the Kenyan port city of Mombasa, 43 per cent of men who said they had sex only with other men were found to be living with HIV,"" the government said, quoting the United Nations report on Global AIDS Epidemic, 2008.,""In Bangkok, HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men rose from 17 per cent in 2003 to 28 per cent in 2005 and it is estimated that as many as 21 per cent new HIV infections in Thailand in 2005 were attributable to unprotected sex between men,"" the Centre said.,The 100-page written submission was filed by the Centre as the court, while reserving the order, had allowed the government to file any additional submission in a written form.,Centre's response came on a PIL filed by gay rights activists seeking the court's direction to decriminalise gay sex among consenting adults in private.,At present, homosexuality is an offence in the country and Section 377 of Indian Penal Code provides punishment for up to life imprisonment for engaging in such acts.,Malhotra pointed out that MSM population is the most vulnerable to infection by HIV.,""More than eight per cent of 25 lakh population of MSM are infected by HIV while the HIV prevalence among the general population is estimated to be less than one per cent,"" he said.,""Unprotected sex between men is still the main mode of HIV transmission in both Canada and the United States – 40 per cent of new HIV diagnoses in Canada in 2006 and 53 per cent in the USA in 2005 are because of gay sex,"" the government said.,""More than half (57 per cent) of the HIV diagnoses to date in Mexico have been attributed to unprotected sex between men,"" Malhotra said quoting from a research paper of 2006.,Earlier, a Bench comprising Chief Justice A P Shah and Justice S Muralidhar had reserved the order and asked the parties to file written submission if they have any additional points to raise in the case.,Gay rights activists had contended that the government by not decriminalising homosexual acts was infringing upon their fundamental right to equality on the ground of morality.,""The Constitution gives fundamental right to equality and it prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex. But the rights of 25 lakh homosexuals in the country are being violated,"" they had contended.,""Moral argument cannot triumph over the constitutional rights in a democratic society where fundamental rights prohibit any discrimination on the ground of sex,"" the activists had said and alleged that gays in the country were being treated as ""second-class citizens"".

,
Near-universal HIV tests and immediate drug treatment for people who test positive would almost eliminate transmission of the deadly virus within a decade, a computer model showed on Wednesday.,Doing this would cost more initially but then save money down the road because there would be fewer HIV-infected people to treat, Reuben Granich and colleagues at the World Health Organization wrote in the journal The Lancet.,The researchers emphasized their findings do not represent new WHO policy or any other guidance but rather stand as a call for discussion on how to better tackle the AIDS epidemic and the role of so-called antiretroviral drugs.,""Although other prevention strategies, alone or in combination, could substantially reduce HIV incidence, our model suggests that only universal voluntary HIV testing and immediate initiation of antiretroviral drugs could reduce transmission to the point at which elimination might be feasible by 2020 for a generalized epidemic, such as that in South Africa,"" they wrote.,Granich and colleagues used data from South Africa as a test case for a generalized epidemic in their model, which assumed all HIV transmission was through heterosexual sex.,This showed that voluntary screening in which at least 90 per cent of the population took part, and immediate drug treatment for those testing positive, could reduce HIV transmission by more than 95 per cent within 10 years.,The AIDS virus infects an estimated 33 million people globally, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, and has killed 25 million. There is no cure.,The advent in the 1990s of combination drug therapy called highly active antiretroviral therapy, or HAART, has extended the lives of many HIV-infected people, particularly in developed countries.,About 3 million people worldwide had received the drug cocktails by the end of 2007, far short of the estimated 6.7 million infected people still in need of treatment, the researchers added.,There are, of course, drawbacks which the researchers and other scientists pointed out. One is how health systems in poor countries can cope with widespread testing, and whether people can stick to the drugs they must take for life.,""At its best, the strategy would prevent morbidity and mortality for the population, both through better treatment of the individual and reduced spread of HIV,"" Geoffrey Garnett, a researcher at Imperial College London, wrote in a commentary in The Lancet.,""At its worst, the strategy will involve over-testing, over-treatment, side effects, resistance, and potentially reduced autonomy of the individual in their choices of care.""

,
The meltdown could be a blessing in disguise for areas like Surat and Alang, where HIV count has been very high. This is due to a sizeable migrant labour force. While over 50 per cent of their population has retuned to their native places in the wake of the recession, experts see an opportunity in this to establish better control over HIV.,Surat has already registered a small dent in the otherwise ever-increasing number of HIV cases, confirmed Rajesh Gopal, Joint Director of the Gujarat State Aids Control Society. ""Out of the 6 lakh migrant labourers, about five lakh are from Orissa alone. A significant number of these workers, which would be over 50 per cent of the total, have now returned to their home state. This has brought down the total number of cases as a temporary impact; but there is a major requirement to check the spread at the point of origin itself,"" Gopal said. ,It has been predicted that the HIV count will be low as long as the labour-intensive industries feel the meltdown heat. But the flip side of the impact would also mean a disruption in the ongoing awareness programmes.,Gaurang Jani, sociologist and consultant of Jyoti Sangh, an NGO that runs an intervention programme for commercial sex workers, said: ""The migrant labourers can carry both the virus as well as the awareness back home. But with the labour-intensive industries like diamond and textile being hit in the state, the inter-state impact of the awareness programmes is also likely to be hit.""

The coalition is a youth-led network of 4,000 young leaders working on youth and HIV/AIDS in 150 countries.,Hans Billimoria, campaign coordinator of Wake up Pune, underlined the need to be positive about raising awareness about HIV. We need to wipe out the stigma and discrimination associated with the virus and offer care and support to those living with HIV. ,According to Ashish Patharkar of Satyam foundation, the corporate world has also been engaged in responding to the HIV crisis. Satyam is one of the first IT companies to adopt a comprehensive workplace policy on HIV/AIDS in the country.

,

,

,
,
,

,
After talking the world of communication by storm, cell phones are now set to revolutionise the field of medicine as well.,Scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) have created a cell phone that can monitor the condition of HIV and malaria patients and test water quality at disaster sites and undeveloped areas.,UCLA electrical engineering professor Aydogan Ozcan has constructed the new innovative imaging technology, which has been miniaturized by researchers in his lab to the point that it can fit in standard cell phones.,The imaging platform, known as LUCAS (Lensless Ultra-wide-field Cell monitoring Array platform based on Shadow imaging), has now been successfully installed in both a cell phone and a webcam. Both devices acquire an image in the same way as using a short wavelength blue light to illuminate a blood, saliva or other fluid sample.,LUCAS captures an image of the microparticles in the solution using a sensor array.,As red blood cells and other microparticles have a distinct diffraction pattern, or shadow image, it becomes easier to identify and count them almost instantaneously by LUCAS using a custom-developed ""decision algorithm"" that compares the captured shadow images to a library of training images.,Data collected by LUCAS can then be sent to a hospital for analysis and diagnosis using the cell phone, or transferred via USB to a computer for transmission to a hospital.,LUCAS is not a substitute for a microscope but rather a complement. Unlike microscopes, which produces detailed images, images produced by LUCAS are grainy and pixelated.,The LUCAS platform's advantage lies in its ability to nearly instantaneously identify and count microparticles, something that is time consuming and difficult to do with a microscope in resource-limited settings. Also, because LUCAS does not use a lens, the only constraint on size is the size of the chip it is built on.,""This technology will not only have great impact in health care applications, it also has the potential to replace cytometers in research labs at a fraction of the cost. A conventional flow-cytometer identifies cells serially, one at a time, whereas tabletop versions of LUCAS can identify thousands of cells in a second, all in parallel, with the same accuracy,"" said Ozcan.,In the current study, Ozcan described an improvement in the LUCAS system, which he calls holographic LUCAS. This improvement allows for identification of smaller particles such as E. coli that were not previously possible.,It is possible to capture a two-dimensional holographic shadow image of the microparticles by controlling the spatial properties of the light source, and the resulting image contains much more information than the classic shadow image.,Now that Ozcan has successfully created prototypes with a cell phone and webcam, his next step is to build from scratch a handheld device incorporating the LUCAS imaging system.,The device could help people in remote areas of the world to monitor the spread of disease, allowing doctors to focus limited resources in the areas of greatest need.,The system also can be used to monitor water quality by detecting hazardous microparticles. In addition to undeveloped areas, LUCAS would be useful for water testing in the event of a disaster which compromises water quality.,The study has been published in the online edition of the journal Lab on a Chip.

Alarmed by rising cases of HIV in the country, Malaysia on Thursday made it compulsory for all Malaysian Muslims intending to get married to undergo a Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) screening beginning next year.,Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak, who chaired a Cabinet meeting on AIDS, said the screening will be made part of pre-marriage courses. The decision was taken to reduce HIV infections, especially among women, which statistics show, is increasing.,""Cumulatively, there are 83,527 HIV cases so far and of this, 14,317 are AIDS cases of which 12,425 people have died,"" he said, adding that AIDS still posed a serious threat to the country.,However, he noted that the country's HIV infection rate has dropped by half over the past five years. There are only 3452 cases this year compared to 6756 in 2003, media reports said.,The deputy premier said more concerted and focused efforts has contributed to the drop in the number of HIV infections annually. Among the major contributors was the Harm Reduction Programme which will be continued to achieve the government's goal of 11 cases per 100,000 population by 2015 compared with 12.8 cases per 100,000 population now, he said.

The Himachal Pradesh government is considering a proposal to make test for HIV-AIDS compulsory for a couple before marriage. At present the focus of the HIV-AIDS' campaign in Himachal Pradesh is on awareness among youth in urban areas, with special emphasis on rural youth by connecting with them through Nehru Yuva Kendras.,Chief Minister Prem Kumar Dhumal made the announcement without giving any further details of the time frame required for implementation of the proposal. In this year's budget speech, the CM had stated that the state would  undertake special endeavour for motivating the youth and make them more aware to undergo a test for HIV-AIDS before marriage. In pursuance of this objective the state launched a mobile AIDS awareness van which would go around colleges and universities in the state for counseling on the subject and also provide free testing facility for them.,The CM said the campaign for AIDS awareness cannot go ahead with active participation and cooperation of the youth. He said the compulsory test for HIV-AIDS before marriage can help in building a strong foundation for healthy society.

,

,

,
,


,
Thirteen out of the 165 prisoners or eight per cent of Yerawada central prison who voluntarily underwent tests for HIV between October and December 2008 have turned out to be HIV positive. Eleven of those who have tested positive are male while two are female prisoners. ,It may be recalled that as many as 32 patients had reportedly died due to AIDS in Yerawada between 2001 and 2006. This matter had been put before the High Court during the hearing of a bail application of another HIV positive prisoner serving a life sentence at Yerawada.,While the application was rejected last year, the issue came under the court's scrutiny. The HC later followed it up with the order for a voluntary counselling and testing project to start in all the state-owned central prisons covering the 7,000-odd prisoners to check the spread of HIV.,Pune and Amravati were the first to start with the project in October 2008. Last week this was extended to prisons of Aurangabad, Nashik and Thane as well. ,There are over 3,300 prisoners in Yerawada jail. If the first lot is a representative sample of what is to come, the prospects of a large number of prisoners at Yerawada turning out to be HIV positive cannot be ruled out.,Following the High Court intervention, the state government issued an order last year for initiating voluntary counselling and HIV testing for prisoners in Amravati and Pune prisons. The pilot project started in Yerawada on October 2 and is being conducted by the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS). ,Disclosing the details of the test, Sachin Pawar, district supervisor of MSACS, said all 13 who were found to be HIV positive prisoners are being given treatment at Sassoon General Hospital. ,""Only two of these had low CD 4 count and so need to be given anti-retroviral therapy. This has already started for one of them and the other will follow soon,"" said Pawar. Jail superintendent Rajendra Dhamane has called the pilot a big success . ""The main thing is this is purely a voluntary initiative. The prisoners have to come forward on their own. Many still have reservations. Some refuse to even acknowledge there is a possibility of them being HIV positive and refuse to be tested. But efforts are on to persuade them to undergo these tests,"" Dhamane said.,Dr Alka Deshpande, head anti-retroviral therapy at JJ Hospital, Mumbai, said while the testing is a commendable step the question remains as to what needs to be done after that.

The family of a seven-year-old cancer patient has alleged that the child contracted HIV infection while undergoing treatment at the Guru Tegh Bahadur (GTB) Hospital in the Capital for lung cancer. ,According to hospital records, he was admitted on February 13, 2007, and was discharged in October. During this period, he was given 12 units of blood which, as per the family's allegations, is the reason for his contracting the virus. ,Deepak's family claimed that after being discharged, the boy was constantly unwell and also lost a lot of weight. When the family took him to a nearby hospital, the doctors advised an ELISA test on the child. ""The test results were positive, so we brought him back to GTB Hospital. But the hospital refuses to give us a hearing,"" said Tilak Ram, Deepak's father. ,The hospital administration, meanwhile, has rubbished the allegations. ""We have been treating the child, who has been critically ill since February last year. Instead of giving us credit for the treatment, the family is making these false allegations. Before coming to GTB, the child had undergone treatment at other nursing homes. How can it be ascertained where the child got the infection from? We have the regional blood transfusion centre in our campus and we take extreme precautions while handling blood,"" said Dr P C Dikshit, Medical Superintendent at the GTB Hospital.

With a rapid increase in the number of HIV positive cases among children, Deoria in eastern Uttar Pradesh is now listed in the A category (worse affected) of HIV-affected districts in the country. ,A hundred villages in the district are marked as worse affected villages. The state has four more districts in the state in the A category.,In a recent survey conducted by the District Aids Control Committee (DACC) in Deoria, it was found that the district has the highest number of HIV positive persons in the age group of 0 to 14 years. Worse, 233 children in Deoria have been tested HIV positive and of these only 23 are receiving medical support. ,Deoria District Magistrate and chairman of the district committee Dr JB Sinha told The Indian Express,"" Large scale migration from the district is one of the major reasons for the spread of HIV."" He added: ""While some of the children have been identified and are getting medical support, children of many HIV positive couples are still not receiving medical care."",According to recent statistics of Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres in the state, Uttar Pradesh has 509 HIV positive boys and 246 girls below the age group of 15. Experts, however, feel that the data is highly underestimated and tests should be conducted across the state for determining the correct numbers.,The DACC and the Uttar Pradesh State AIDS Control Society have also marked 100 vulnerable villages in Deoria, especially for the 0-14 year age group. The society will focus on preventing the spread of the disease and providing medical support to the people, besides spreading awareness among the migrant communities.,""We will appoint two workers for five villages each, who will identify and provide medical support to the positive people,"" said Sinha. ,The administration will chalk out a comprehensive plan to tackle the problem soon, he added.

If studies in the West talk of NeuroAIDS and how the virus can sneak into the brain to cause dementia, back home in Pune, experts at the National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) have planned an ambitious study to find the prevalence of neurocognitive impairment in HIV infected individuals.,NeuroAIDS that is looked at as the Achilles' heel of HIV therapy has had patients forget phone numbers and slacken their movements. Not everyone worsens and doctors can't predict who will. The Indian Express had reported earlier that scientists at NARI had standardised tests to suit the Indian population and detect the neurocognitive impairment of HIV infected individuals.,Now armed with a battery of 'Indian culture specific' neurological tests to diagnose symptoms which afflicts at least one in five persons, a collaborative study will get underway in Pune. The study partners include NARI and University of California, says Dr R S Paranjape, Director of NARI.,Dr Sanjay Mehendale, Deputy Director, Senior Grade, NARI, who is the principal Investigator told The Indian Express that studies will be done on 300 HIV positive individuals and 300 participants who were not affected with HIV. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has provided NARI a place at Model Colony for setting up an Anti-retroviral treatment (ART) centre apart from laboratory facilities,The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has given the green signal for the study, Dr Manisha Ghate, Assistant Director NARI, said. There is increasing evidence in the West that shows cognitive difficulties among HIV infected individuals and hence the study will include tests that check memory, motor skills and neuro-psychological function.,According to Ghate, a pilot study using these tests had been conducted among some 30 HIV-infected individuals and a fair number (47 per cent) showed neurological impairment. Ghate feels these studies are just the tip of the iceberg and underlines the importance of the proposed study to understand the neurological impairment of HIV infected individuals.

,
The seventh Anti Retroviral Treatment (ART) centre might have brought some relief to HIV positive patients in the state, but those who have already crossed the first line drug regime will still have to wait for long before they get their turn at the only centre in Gujarat providing the second line drug regime. ,Gujarat recently received its second line drug regime, but the treatment is being administered only to patients in serious need of the same due to the limited stock. The facility, which is available at the Ahmedabad Civil Hospital, has been presently given to 15 patients only. According to the Gujarat State Aids Control Society (GSACS), over 8,000 HIV patients are registered with the government and are undergoing the first line drug regime at the ART centres. Of this, at least 3 per cent (approximately 240 HIV positive) are in need of the second line drug. ,Daksha Patel, president of the Gujarat State Network of People Living with HIV Aids (GSNP+), said: ""We have over 6,399 HIV positive patients from across the state registered with us and over 450 of them are in need of the second line regime. The numbers might be more if the whole state is taken into consideration."",While some of the patients approach private hospitals, a majority of them do not get the treatment done due to the heavy costs involved. Considering various clinical tests and the cost of medicines, a patient under second line drug regime has to spend anywhere over Rs 10,000 per month. ,""Most of the patients registered with us barely make a living of Rs 2,000. A treatment at private hospitals is out of question for them,"" said Manisha Saduke, a member of city based NGO, AP+. ,With the set of criteria for the selection of patients, there is an unending wait for many of them. As per the guidelines of the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), patients with the Ahmedabad ART centre will be the first to receive the treatment, followed by those registered with the government's first line drug regime. Finally patients belonging to the BPL category patients not registered with the GSACS will be treated. ,""An expenditure of Rs 1 lakh per year has to be borne by the government for every patient. Besides the limited stock of medicines provided by the Centre, there is also a shortage of funds,"" said Dr Pradeep Kumar, Additional Project Director, GSACS. ,He added: ""The treatment would not be available to those undergoing therapy at private hospitals since they follow a different protocol regarding medicines. Moreover, there is a high risk involved in shifting the therapy.""

More than 10 private hospitals in the city have come forward to participate in a government scheme of Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC) for HIV testing at private medical institutions. This will act as a boon to those who wish to get checked in private hospitals with the same reliability as in public hospitals and with full anonymity.,The ICTCs provide free HIV testing facilities and counselling for the HIV infected. Hospitals like Safiee hospital in Churni Road and other small maternity homes and hospitals in Malad, Goregaon, Mulund and Mahim have signed a memorandum of understanding with the Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS), apart from five Family Health International's Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) clinics and two Population Service International clinics.,The MDACS had invited proposals from private hospitals, clinics, maternity homes and even private laboratories to start ICTC centres on their premises like other district societies in the country under the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO). ""The idea is to practise uniform testing methods across the medical institutions, both public and private. This will not stop private clients to opt for a more expensive test — the PCR test that costs approximately Rs 2,000,"" said Dr Ruchi Chiplunkar, the joint director of Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS).,""The NACO will provide free rapid test kits for the ICTCs coming up at private hospitals and will also provide necessary training to their technicians and counsellors,"" said Dr Chiplunkar. ""NACO is not looking at private hospitals now, especially big hospitals; in fact it has set criteria like those maternity homes conducting more than 50 deliveries, only those hospitals or clinics treating more than 100 tuberculosis patients a month or 100 patients with sexually-transmitted diseases a month. Also those laboratories performing more than 150 HIV tests a month. The middle and upper middle class population is our target."",The NACO decided to open ICTC centres at maternity homes and hospitals where deliveries are conducted as nearly 35 per cent of mothers delivering in the state approach private hospital for healthcare. This is to curb the mother-to-child transmission. ""At present, there is no data on the general masses opting for HIV testing in private hospitals in Mumbai,"" she said. ,Dr Chiplunkar, however, said they have asked NACO on the insistence of the Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Socities of India (FOGSI) to relax the criteria as many maternity homes with less than 30 deliveries a month have expressed their interest to start ICTC centres.,With the opening of ICTCs, the private hospitals will be able to provide reliable HIV testing facilities to people. ""At present, manyof these hospitals are providing only one test for HIV. This may not be reliable as it may give false results. The ICTCs always follow the standard three-test procedure and that is a reliable method,"" she said.

It provides the first signal that a microbicide gel may be able to protect women from HIV."" ,In fact, the study, known as HPTN 035, began in 2005 and enrolled 3,099 women at six sites in Africa and one in the United States.,The clinical trial tested two candidate microbicide gels for safety and their ability to prevent HIV infection: PRO 2000 (0.5 percent dose), and BufferGel (ReProtect Inc., Baltimore).,Participants reported regular use of the gels (81 percent of sex acts) and nearly all (99 per cent) said they would use the products if approved for HIV prevention. Condom usage was also high throughout the course of the trial. ,In the final analysis, 194 women in the study became infected with HIV. Of these infections, 36 occurred in the PRO 2000 group, 54 in the BufferGel group, 51 in the placebo group and 53 in those who did not use gel.,Based on these data, PRO 2000 was 30 per cent effective, while BufferGel had no detectable preventive effect on HIV infection, the 'ScienceDaily' reported.,""Although more data are needed to conclusively determine whether PRO 2000 protects women from HIV infection, the results of this study are encouraging. An effective microbicide would be a valuable tool women could use to protect themselves against HIV and one that could substantially reduce the number of new HIV infections worldwide,"" said Anthony S Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which funded the study.

As part of this trial, such infants who have not received a single dose of Nevaripine (NVP) ( an anti-HIV drug to ensure prevention of transmission from mother to child) and those who have received the NVP dose will be studied. Around 42 children will be selected in two groups with a different combination of anti-HIV drugs. One set will be given drugs like AZT, 3TC and NVP, while the other group will include the same drugs barring NVP and will be replaced with a protease inhibitor. ,The study has been approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research and has received grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), USA, says Khadse. While the clinic will be a place of research and  studies, their basic aim is to provide care, support and psycho-social counselling to these children.  ,While they are availing of ART from the centre, it is important to support the medicines with adequate nutrition.,Hence, the clinic has even displayed boards that recommend the amount of food— with calorie intake, protein, fat and carbohydrate content— that the children should  have. , The clinic was inaugurated at a function on Wednesday.

Earlier, The Indian Express had reported that scientists at the NARI had standardised tests to suit the Indian population and detect the neurocognitive impairment of HIV infected individuals. ,Now, armed with a battery of 'Indian culture specific' neurological tests to diagnose symptoms which afflict at least one in five people, a collaborative study will get underway in Pune. The study partners include NARI and University of California, said Dr R S Paranjape, Director of NARI. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has given the green signal for the study, Dr Manisha Ghate, Assistant Director, NARI, said. ,Dr Sanjay Mehendale, Deputy Director, Senior Grade, NARI, who is the principal investigator, told The Indian Express that studies will be done on 300 HIV positive individuals and 300 participants who are not affected with HIV. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has provided a space at Model Colony for setting up an anti-retroviral treatment (ART) centre, apart from laboratory facilities. ,There is increasing evidence in the West that shows cognitive difficulties among HIV infected individuals and hence the study will include tests that check memory, motor skills and neuro-psychological function. According to Ghate, a pilot study using these tests had been conducted among 30 HIV infected individuals and 47 per cent showed neurological impairment. ,Access to anti-retroviral drugs has helped in improving the health, survival and functioning of HIV infected individuals. But since people are living longer with the virus, the overall prevalence of neuroAIDS appears to be increasing, researchers said. ,""In India, we need to answer questions like what is the prevalence of these neurological changes in HIV infected individuals, how do they manifest clinically and are there any neurological benefits of anti-retroviral therapy,"" Ghate said. ,,,* The National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) at Pune and Tuberculosis Research Centre (TRC) at Chennai will conduct a phase clinical trial to test a combination of two AIDS vaccine candidates. ,* Dr R S Paranjape, Director of NARI, said the two vaccine candidates include ADVAX and TBC-M4 that will be tested in a prime boost regimen. A total of 32 volunteers will be enrolled for the trial that will start soon at Pune and Chennai. YRG CARE, Chennai, will collaborate with the TRC for advocacy and community mobilisation for the phase 1 trial. ,* A statement issued here said the joint trial will be conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) and International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI).  ,* The TBC-M4 vaccine candidate was tested by ICMR, NACO and IAVI at a phase 1 trial at the TRC in Chennai earlier and the results were promising.

,
A vaginal microbicide gel has for the first time shown some promise to prevent HIV infection in women in a clinical trial involving more than 3,000 subjects in the US and southern Africa.,While making a presentation on the trial's findings at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI), the researchers said that one 0.5 per cent dose of a microbicide designed to prevent HIV from attaching to cells in the genital tract, was 30 per cent effective.,While the results of the study known as HPTN 035 are encouraging, the researchers behind it say that additional evidence is needed to determine more definitively its effectiveness.,""These findings provide the first signal that a microbicide gel may be able to prevent women from HIV infection,"" says Dr Salim S Abdool Karim, professor of clinical Epidemiology at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, pro vice-chancellor (research) at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, South Africa, and director the Centre for the AIDS Program of Research in South Africa, who led the multi-centre study for the US-based Microbicide Trials Network (MTN).,""Indeed, for the millions of women at risk for HIV, especially young women in Africa, there is now a glimmer of hope. But these findings also indicate that more research is needed; we can't yet say that we have an effective microbicide,"" he added.,Microbicides are substances intended to reduce or prevent the sexual transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections when applied topically.,While various microbicides are being tested in clinical trials, none of them has been approved for use as yet because previous trials have yielded disappointing results.,The study—conducted between February 2005 and September 2008, and involving 3,099 women at six sites in Africa and one in the US—evaluated the safety and effectiveness of two candidate microbicides for preventing male-to-female sexual transmission of HIV.,""I am particularly impressed by and grateful to the women who took part in HPTN 035."" We have reached an important milestone in HIV prevention research, and these women deserve credit for the success of the study,"" said Dr Sharon Hillier, vice chairman and professor, department of obstetrics and gynaecology and reproductive sciences at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, and MTN principal investigator.

,

,

,
,
,

,
The AIDS virus is quickly adapting across large groups of people to avoid triggering the human immune system, posing another challenge in the search for a potential vaccine, researchers said on Wednesday.,Scientists know the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, constantly mutates within individual people to find ways to attack cells.,But the study published in the journal Nature suggests changes that help the virus do this are increasingly passed on in the wider population.,""What was previously clear is the virus could evolve within each infected person but that doesn't really matter from a vaccine perspective if the virus at the population level is staying the same,"" said Philip Goulder, an immunologist at Oxford University who led the study.,""The implication is that once we have found an effective vaccine, it would likely need to be changed to keep pace with the rapidly evolving virus."",There is no cure for AIDS and 33 million people globally are infected with HIV. Cocktails of drugs can control the virus and keep patients healthy. AIDS has killed more than 25 million people since the early 1980s, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa.,Researchers are trying to find vaccines that either prevent infection or would control the virus so that patients are less likely to transmit it – a so-called therapeutic vaccine.,""The process of the virus adapting is happening before our eyes at quite a speed, and it is something we need to take into account when making our vaccines,"" Goulder said.,HIV attacks the immune system, the body's natural defences. Like other viruses, it cannot replicate on its own but must hijack a cell and turn it into a virus factory.,HIV must evade several genes to do this, including an immunity gene called HLA.,The team, which included researchers from Australia and Japan, analyzed the genetic sequences of HIV and versions of HLA genes known to control the virus in 2,800 people.,Some people have a version of the gene that is more protective. In the study, the researchers found that mutations that allow HIV to evade immune responses directed by HLA were more common in people with the protective variant of the gene.,This was strong evidence for HIV adaptation to the human immune system among the wider population, Goulder added in a telephone interview.,This means the so-called escape mutation is circulating in more and more people and accumulating in the wider population of those infected with HIV, he said.,""We saw similar effects in every mutation that we looked at,"" Goulder said. ""This shows that HIV is extremely adept at adapting to the immune responses in human populations that are most effective at containing the virus.""

Long before anyone knew about Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or HIV, and its subsequent syndrome, AIDS, Professor Francoise Barre-Sinoussi was intrigued by an unknown disease that did not respond to treatment. Twenty-five years after isolating the virus, Prof Barre-Sinoussi maintains that her work is far from over. Joint winner of 2008 Nobel Prize in Medicine for discovering HIV, Barre-Sinoussi is in the Capital for a symposium on HIV-AIDS and its co-infections like TB and Hepatitis. ,""I don't know how long it will take but research must continue till we have the vaccine,"" she tells Newsline. ""We now know a lot about the obstacles in developing the vaccine. (And though) we do not know the best treatment plan for patients with co-infections like TB and Hepatitis, what we do know is research must continue."",Working without the perfect vaccine, Barre-Sinoussi says there is a need for new approach to treatment of the deadliest disease. She says use of Anti-Retroviral Treatment (ART) on HIV-negative patients might be the next step in fighting the HIV-AIDS epidemic. ""We need a new approach and there are promising results from studies underway in many countries that ART given to non-infected persons is good intervention."",It is important for high-burden countries like India — with over 2.5 million HIV-infected — to introduce advanced technology in national plans, especially in monitoring and surveillance of people living with HIV and its co-infections, she says. ""Screening has to be advanced when it concerns such a huge population. Though it may be expensive, the government has to weigh the cost of technology against the cost of disease burden. ,""It will help if international effort is consistent and funds are channelised in using the best screening procedures; the focus should be on early diagnosis."",On the national policies for prevention of HIV-AIDS, she emphasises on the need for a political will. ""We did not know where to begin when I started work in Cambodia, in 1995. But by 2008, the country had 50 sites for patients with opportunistic infections and antiretroviral treatment, 26 sites for paediatric HIV care, and four sites for monitoring CD4+ counts. ""They will soon be able to cover everyone who needs treatment just because the government is willing. This is not only improving the health of HIV-infected people but also those with other diseases, such as tuberculosis."",Is she hopeful about the way forward? ""If you lose hope, you lose everything. There is always hope in life because  there is always hope in science,"" she says.

Krishna Koushik (name changed), a trucker from a village in Andhra Pradesh, spends most of the year on the highway. On feeling unwell during a routine stop at Dhulagarh truck depot, a depot staff asked him to get checked by a doctor in the depot.,""I had fever and diarrhoea and was asked to visit the clinic for a check-up,"" said Kaushik. Here it was revealed that he was affected with a sexually transmitted disease. ,Set up by a joint partnership between Apollo Tyres and Ambuja Cement, the health care centre at the Dhaulagarh depot is aimed to help truckers, among the high-risk category of people affected with HIV/AIDS. ,""Most of the truckers spend days away from their family and often stop at small joints for quick sex, contracting sexually transmitted diseases,"" said Sukanta Das, the counsellor at the centre. ,The clinic, housed in two rooms, has a doctor's chamber and a counselling centre. At a nominal fee of Rs 15, the truckers are provided treatment and medicines are given to them free of cost. ,The clinic authorities are also holding talks with the West Bengal State AIDS Prevention and Control Society and city-based NGOs for expansion of the clinic to provide medicines for truckers afflicted with AIDS.,""It is not easy for truckers to discuss their sexual problems as talking about sex is considered a taboo in our society. Therefore we have approached people working at the grassroots level like cleaners of truck companies at the depot to persuade the truck drivers to talk about their sexual problem,"" said Satasil Das, programme officer with Ambuja Cement. ,With six transport operators working at the depot, nearly 20 ""peer educators"" are given basic training about sex diseases and imparted communication skills to bring truckers to the clinic.,""Since we are from the same region they feel comfortable talking to us about their sexual problems. It is not easy, however, as it takes a lot of persuasion to get them to discuss their sex problems,"" said VR Rao, a peer educator, who persuaded Koushik to visit the centre.

Analysis of trends among 15 to 24-year-olds in countries with high prevalence of HIV infection indicates a decline HIV rate, said Dr Robert Bollinger, director of Johns Hopkins Centre of Clinical and Global Education, USA while highlighting the top ten developments in HIV prevention and treatment in 2008. ,He was addressing a gathering of students, lecturers and academicians at the B J Medical College (BJMC) on Thursday. ,Bollinger emphasised that prevention of the disease was the key to curb the spread of the virus. In fact, while there is a decline in HIV infection in certain communities of Africa and India, researchers have realised that they have underestimated the HIV infections in USA. ""We do have a large number of infections every year,"" says Bollinger. ,The academician quoted several studies to showcase how a single drug like nevirapine prevents transmission of HIV from mother to child via breast milk while on the other hand the failure of the STEP vaccine trial has put on hold various initiatives related to anti-HIV vaccine development. ,There has been good news and bad news in 2008, Bollinger said. A CHER study on when to start treatment for HIV positive children has led to WHO changing its guidelines on the issue. The study shows that early anti-retroviral treatment (ART) has reduced mortality by 76 per cent in children and hence, regardless of their clinical CD4 count status, therapy is started for children below one year. ,There have been several key changes in laying new guidelines for starting treatment for adults who are infected with HIV, says Bollinger. There is concern over the toxicity of drug stavudine, which has not been recommended as a drug for first line treatment in USA, but is used in India and elsewhere. ,In his talk, Bollinger also underlined the need to develop alternate methods to diagnose tuberculosis in children infected with HIV apart from undertaking research in alternate systems of medicine for treament of HIV.

,
The Global TB Control Report released here on World TB Day revealed that one out of four TB deaths in the world are HIV-related, twice as many as previously recognised. ,Experts said that these numbers should serve as a warning signal to high-burden countries like India to desist from reducing investment in public health in view of the global economic meltdown. ,They also said that the increase was a manifestation of more effective screening procedures now available in many Asian and African countries. ""It must be understood that the data has doubled not because of increased disease burden. The disease burden has been the same, the difference is that we now have better screening, which is giving us more numbers,"" said Alasdair Reid, TB/HIV adviser with UNAIDS.  ,According to the report, there were an estimated 1,37-million new cases of TB among people living with HIV and 4,56,000 deaths. ,Launching the report Dr Mario Raviglione, WHO Director in the Stop TB Department said, ""We can confirm that TB incidence has been slowly declining since 2004, which is good news, but the decline rate is less than one percent per year and it could take several millennia to eliminate TB,"" he said. ,According to the report, the case detection rate had stagnated at just over 60 percent implying that one third of the existing cases were either never detected, and the patients died, or were never notified. Emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB, which has affected close to half a million patients has slowed down the progress in TB control.,Ten percent of MDR TB cases were also found to be extensively drug-resistant (XDR), with this highly resistant strain having spread to 55 countries.

The number of people infected with both tuberculosis and HIV is twice than what researchers previously estimated, a UN health agency report said.,The annual report released by the World Health Organization reveals that one out of four TB deaths is HIV related, twice as many as previously recognised.,In 2007, there were an estimated 1.37 million new cases of tuberculosis among HIV-infected people and 456,000 deaths. About 700,000 people were infected with both in 2006.,""These findings point to an urgent need to find, prevent and treat tuberculosis in people living with HIV and to test for HIV in all patients with TB in order to provide prevention, treatment and care. Countries can only do that through stronger collaborative programmes and stronger health systems that address both diseases,"" said WHO Director-General Margaret Chan.,The report reveals a sharp increase in HIV testing among people being treated for TB, especially in Africa.,In 2004, just four per cent of TB patients in the region were tested for HIV, in 2007 that number rose to 37 per cent, with several countries testing more than 75 per cent of TB patients for their HIV status.,This figure reflects an improvement in the quality of the country data, which are now more representative and available from more countries than in previous years. ,However, the number of new tuberculosis cases remained stable in 2007 and the percentage of the world's population becoming ill with the disease has continued the slow decline.,Because of increased testing for HIV among TB patients, more people are getting appropriate treatment though the numbers still remain a small fraction of those in need.,In 2007, 200,000 HIV-positive TB patients were enrolled on co-trimoxazole treatment to prevent opportunistic infections and 100,000 were on antiretroviral therapy.,""We have to stop people living with HIV from dying of tuberculosis,"" said Executive Director of UNAIDS Michel Sidibe. ""Universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support must include TB prevention, diagnosis and treatment. When HIV and TB services are combined, they save lives."",TB/HIV co-infection and drug-resistant forms of tuberculosis present the greatest challenges, the report says and expresses concerns over an increasing shortage in funding.,To meet the 2009 milestones in the Stop TB Partnership's Global Plan, the funding shortfall for these 94 countries has risen to about USD 1.5 billion.,""The financial crisis must not derail the implementation of the Global Plan to Stop TB. Now is the time to scale-up financing for effective interventions for the prevention, treatment and care of TB worldwide,"" said Michel Kazatchkine, Executive Director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.

When they married, he knew he was HIV-positive, she did not. By the time she found out, it was too late to save herself - but not too late, she decided, to save other women.,In the nine years since she was diagnosed positive, Vaishali Sanjay Shinde, now 28, has been on a single-handed mission to educate women on HIV. Based on the theme 'Pratyakala Manoos Mahnoon Jagnaycha Haqq Ahey' (Everyone has the right to live as a human being), her one-woman campaign not only seeks to make women aware of the dangers of AIDS but also stresses equal rights, self-reliance, dignity and unity among women.,A Class X dropout and four feet tall, Vaishali has a towering presence on stage where she delivers fiery speeches on AIDS awareness. ""I tell girls to ask their grooms to get HIV test certificates before marriage. This should be made mandatory,"" she says.,Vaishali had launched her mission out of bitterness against her late husband and his family. She believes they deliberately destroyed her life. ,""It was only eight days before he died that my husband Sanjay told me he had been visiting commercial sex workers before marriage and contracted HIV. All through three years of marriage, he and his family kept telling me that he was suffering from TB,"" says Vaishali, a resident of Belwade Budruk in Satara district.,Vaishali married Sanjay in 1997. In 1999 they had a child, who died three months after birth. Sanjay died in 2000.,Sanjay's confession left Vaishali numb but she took care of him. ""In the end he couldn't even get up from the bed, yet I took care of him till he died,"" she says. ""Now when I reach my end, who will take care of me? I will fight it alone,"" she says.,For all the care she took of him, Vaishali says she will never forgive her husband. ""He lied to me... he destroyed my life. My child too died of AIDS. How can I forgive such a man? He deliberately ruined my life,"" she says.,""My in-laws are all educated, yet they did not think once before marrying me to an HIV-affected man. I will show no mercy to them,"" she adds. ,Vaishali was diagnosed with HIV soon after Sanjay died. She sued her in-laws in a lower court in Satara for cheating her. The court sentenced her parents-in-law to six months in jail in 2006 but Vaishali, not satisfied, appealed in the district court. ""They should get at least 10 years in jail,"" she says.,At a function in Pimpri on Saturday, she was given an award by the Vishwakalyan Sanstha for her courage and exemplary service towards mankind.,""My fight for the protection of women will continue till my death. I have campaigned against AIDS in Satara, Solapur, Nagar, Ratnagiri, Chiplun and Pune. I will carry my mission with the help of voluntary organisations to every nook and corner of Maharashtra,"" she says.

The suicide committed by four members of a family, which suffered from HIV/AIDS, in Vadodara has raised questions over the effectiveness of the counselling and Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) centres set up across the state to curb such incidents. ,The Gujarat State Aids Control Society (GSACS) has asked the Gujarat state network of positive people (GSNP+) to investigate into the incident and find out how this has happened.,Pradeep Kumar, the additional project director, GSACS, said, ""We have asked the network in Vadodara to inquire into the incident."" For members of a family, including two minor daughters, who were HIV positive, committed suicide on Wednesday by consuming poison at their residence in Makarpura area of Vadodara.,There are more than 7,200 patients (as on December 2008) including 400 children registered with seven ARTs in the state. ,The sources in these ART centres say that the effort in counselling patients is not proving to be enough.,It also suggests the voluntary organisations and networks whose job is to identify people with such disease, register them, observe their behavioural change, and create and enable environment so that they don't feel aloof from the society, have not be able to do justice to their job. ,The voluntary organisations agree. ""I think there are some holes which need to be plugged. This was a very unfortunate incident. But some times counselling alone cannot help,"" said Kamlesh Bhatt of Vikas Jyoti, an organisation working in the HIV/AIDS field for the last nine years.,""Those suffering from HIV/AIDS also might have other problems and that's why they take such extreme step. But we need to put in more effort,"" said Bhatt. ,He said, ""It's very important to make them (victims of HIV/AIDS) mentally strong. But again there are many reasons for a person committing a suicide."",In January 2008 another such incident was reported in which only the women in the family had committed suicide three months after having been diagnosed with HIV. ,A 25-year-old woman was detected with HIV after also having been diagnosed with tuberculosis. ,The woman was in a state of depression after being diagnosed with the virus. According to police and family members, the woman was also much concerned about her child's future.,Defending the networks working under GSACS, Kumar said sometimes there are socio-economic reasons behind a person's death. ,""From what I have heard, the family which committed suicide also had socio-economic problems. This could have been one of the reasons for them taking such an extreme step.""

Early administration of antiretroviral treatment can reduce the rate of AIDS development and deaths in HIV-positive patients by 28 per cent, according to an international study.,The study analysed information from more than 45,000 patients in Europe and North America, and combined data from 15 international cohorts.,The best moment to instate antiretroviral treatment has been the subject of debate for some time.,The immune system's CD4 cell count, which falls as HIV infection progresses, is one of the main tools for establishing a guideline cut-off point.,Present guidelines recommend waiting for the CD4 count to fall below 350 cells per millilitre in asymptomatic patients.,While many a time it has been suggested that initiating treatment earlier could improve outcome, the correct administration of the treatment has remained difficult for fear of the side effects associated with the drugs.,The study report, whose first author is Professor Jonathan Sterne of the UK-based University of Bristol, suggests that it is now possible to consider instating treatment earlier without unduly affecting the patient''s quality of life with the aid of new families of drugs and new, less toxic combinations.,Data for the study were obtained from 21,247 patients who were followed up during the period prior to instatement of combined antiretroviral therapy, and 24,444 patients who were followed up from the beginning of treatment.,The researchers observed that waiting to administer the combined therapy until CD4 levels had fallen to between 251 and 350 cells per millilitre was associated with a 28 per cent higher rate of development of AIDS and death than beginning treatment when levels were between 351 and 450 cells per millilitre.,They revealed that the adverse effects of delaying therapy were directly linked to the drop in the CD4 count.,According to them, waiting to treat until the CD4 count was below those levels was also associated with a higher mortality rate at 13 per cent, though the effect on mortality was smaller than the combined effect on developing AIDS and death.,The new findings are expected to help doctors worldwide decide on the best time to begin antiretroviral treatment.,A research article on the study has been published in the online edition of The Lancet.

Even as the surveys in 2006 and 2007 reported a decline in HIV, the annual exercise of tapping the trends for prevalence of the virus will now begin on April 15.  City-based National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) will commence the exercise for eight states from Wednesday. ,Dr R S Paranjape, director, NARI said that the core team of epidemiologists is located at the institute and has been involved in training the trainers on how to conduct the survey. National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) conducts this annual exercise all over the country with the help of National Institute of Health and Family Welfare and National Institute of Medical Statistics since 1998. ,This surveillance monitors the trends and levels of HIV epidemic among different population groups in the country.  It was estimated in 2007 that there are 2.31 million people living with HIV/AIDS in India with an estimated adult HIV prevalence of 0.34 per cent. An overall decline in HIV prevalence was also found among ante natal care clinic attendees. ,Dr Sanjay Mehendale, deputy director, senior grade, NARI who is coordinating the HIV sentinel surveillance programme said that NARI has been entrusted the task since 2006 for seven states of Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Goa, Gujarat, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Diu and Daman and  for Mumbai as a separate location. ,A total of 97 sites in Maharashtra, 54 in Madhya Pradesh, 46 in Rajasthan, 50 in Gujarat, 8 in Goa, 17 in Mumbai, two in Diu and Daman and one in Dadra and Nagar Haveli have been identified to conduct the surveillance. ""NARI is responsible for the training, monitoring, supervision and improving the quality of the programme since 2006,"" says Mehendale. ,The sample size of pregnant women at ANC sites will be 400, while 250 patients will be selected at the identified sexually  transmitted infection sites in each state. A sample size of 250 people will be identified among the groups for targeted interventions like men having sex with men, female sex workers, injecting drug users, truck drivers and migrant workers. ,The surveillance programme will involve collection of blood samples. ""This time the team will collect dried blood smears,"" Mehendale said. NARI has also been involved in quality control measures , selection of new testing laboratories, data analysis and provide suggestion for improvement of future round of surveys.

A worker at a cloth merchant's shop at Akurdi, Takale (28) spent heavily on medication before he was taken on the government's anti-retroviral treatment programme at Sassoon General Hospital. Takale is now resistant to the drugs and has been advised to take the second line treatment that is available only at JJ Hospital in Mumbai. ,Despite recommendations from doctors at Sassoon, he does not fit the criteria laid down by the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) to seek a second line treatment at a government centre.,Like Takale, Arjun Ukirde from Ahmednagar has also been rejected by the government's ART centre at JJ Hospital as he does not fulfill the criteria that the patient should have necessarily taken the first line drugs from a government centre for six months. ,Now, Takale, Ukirde and four other HIV positive patients have moved the Bombay High Court, filing a PIL under the umbrella of the Human Rights Law Network and Network for People Living with HIV in Maharashtra (NMP+).,Shabana Patel, Advocacy Officer of the NMP+, said they are challenging the criteria for selection of patients for second line treatment. In Maharashtra there is only centre of excellence at JJ Hospital that gives the drugs. ,Recently started, the second line treatment is provided to nearly 125 patients, from Maharashtra and Goa.,""I had taken medication at Sassoon from 2007 but grew resistant. Doctors advised me to take second-line treatment and at that time the government did not provide the medicines. I had no option but to approach a private practitioner. Now, doctors at JJ Hospital's ART Centre say I am not eligible for second-line treatment,"" Takale said. The cost of medication is Rs 8,000 a month and he can no longer afford the treatment. ,Dr D B Kadam, Head of the ART Centre at Sassoon, said the patients will be given second-line treatment at a government centre only if he has consistently taken medication for six months and has had the CD4 count tested twice. ,At present, 4,700 HIV patients are on free ART that is provided at Sassoon General Hospital while 18,700 HIV-positive patients are on the hospital rolls but do not qualify for ART as their CD4 count is not less than 250. ,The CD4 count tells the doctor how strong the patient's immune system is and how far the HIV disease has advanced. Only six patients from Pune are among the 125-odd HIV patients who are currently getting second-line drugs at JJ Hospital.

It's a chilling story that reminds one of Arthur Ashe and Magic Johnson. But 38-year-old Manipur bodybuilder Pradipkumar's nine-year journey — from learning that he is HIV-positive to becoming a champion muscleman — is perhaps unparalleled in the Indian sports fraternity.,In the summer of 2000, Khundrakpam Pradipkumar Singh, a busy wrestler and powerlifter hailing from West Imphal, was shattered when he learnt that he was infected with the killer virus. But instead of going into a shell, he turned to one of the toughest disciplines in sports ¿ bodybuilding — to prove a point. And in December 2006, he was crowned Mr Manipur.,Three years on, he continues to add trophies to his kitty, but he reckons that ""society's apathy"" towards the HIV infection has turned him into a ""beggar"".,A bitter man today, the champion is in town for the Senior National Bodybuilding Championship, organised by the Defence Ministry's Ordnance Factories Sports Promotion Board. ,Recalling his painful journey since getting the infection — which he reckons he picked up from careless use of syringes when he used to take drugs ¿ he said: ""I have achieved so much despite the problems I face as an HIV-positive person. Everyone praises from a distance, but no one wants to come up and help financially. To continue competing at the national and state level, I need Rs 30,000 every month just for nutrition food. Yet, no one wants to give me a job, not even the government."",""I don't know what to do,"" Pradipkumar told The Indian Express on the sidelines of the preparatory day of the two-day championship to be held at the Salt Lake Stadium starting tomorrow. He is contesting in the 55-kg category in this event.,Lamenting that he is sick and tired of ""begging for money"" from family and friends, he said he has reached a point when he is seriously considering quitting the sport that he's excelled in. ""How long can I go on begging for money? I am not new in the circuit, I have been Mr Manipur. The Manipur State AIDS Control Society has been covering my anti-retroviral therapy entirely. A documentary on me was aired in New York. But there's no job, no sponsor. I am on my own,"" he rues. ,The AIDS Control Society's contract — he was supposed to get Rs 18,000 every month for a year — didn't last more than three months and that has left him in a financial airpocket.,It took Pradipkumar, one of six siblings, time to recover from the shock after learning that he is HIV-positive. But he hit the gym in 2003, and three years on, he won the Mr Manipur title. He didn't stop there, finishing sixth, fourth and second in the next three national championships. ,""See, I am only getting better,"" he said. ""That's the difference with the famous Magic Johnson, who retired from the sport shortly after contracting the disease. I have, instead, decided to take up bigger challenges after learning that I won't live long. My challenge is against the virus. And my means is bodybuilding, one of the toughest sports, especially for an AIDS patient,"" he asserts. ,Today, apart from hunting for sponsors and preparing his body for bigger challenge — like this national championship that can get him a ticket to the Asian tourneys — Pradipkumar is nurturing budding bodybuilders from Manipur who are infected by the killer virus. ,""It's my way of giving back something to society. I want to stand up as an example for kids — don't make the mistake that I made, say no to drugs, or you will pay the price like me,"" he said.

A genetically-altered Australian cousin of tobacco plant could become the source of a potent chemical that promises to contain spread of HIV through sexual intercourse, a new finding announced on Tuesday suggests.,The scientists have shown that transgenic versions of a plant Nicotiana benthamiana, also known as 'Tjuntiwari' in the native language, may be able to produce large quantities of a protein griffithsin which can be used as an anti-HIV microbicide gel.,The protein has shown capabilities of neutralizing HIV as it binds to the virus molecule in such a way that the virus could not disguise itself from the immune system of humans.,Anti-HIV microbicide gel directly targets entry of the virus and averts infection at the surfaces but at present they are being produced using biologicals like bacteria E coli, an expensive process which is not cost-effective.,Scientists across the world were looking for a natural source of the protein, for producing anti-HIV microbicide gel, which can prevent women from getting sexually transmitted diseases.,The researchers from USA and UK altered the genetic nature of the plant using a tobacco mosaic virus which produced the protein griffithsin.,They infected more than 9,300 plants in the process and managed to extract substantial amount of the protein from the leaves of the transgenic plant.,""The technique can allow researchers to grow sufficient quantities of griffithsin in Nicotiana benthamiana, a close relative of tobacco, to test the HIV entry inhibitors in clinical trials"" Kenneth E Palmerb, lead researcher wrote in the paper published in the US based journal 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.',If proven effective in clinical trials, the protein could provide a new means of HIV prevention, the authors say.

Taking a major leap in AIDS research, scientists have claimed that they have found a cure for the HIV virus by using a long established cancer treatment to help destroy the killer disease—bone marrow transplants.,Doctors have successfully treated one patient using the method and are confident the process will work for other sufferers.,In their opinion, using of bone marrow transplants to cure HIV could become common in just five years.,The procedure involves using bone marrow stem cells already used to help beat blood cancers like leukaemia and lymphoma.,The man who was cured of HIV is 43 years old and had carried the virus for many years. He was also suffering from leukaemia.,He was treated after doctors exchanged his bone marrow with that of a donor with a rare natural resistance to HIV.,And since three years of treatment, he has no detectable signs of the disease in his body.,""I can see the day when it might be possible to treat many HIV patients with a bone marrow transplant from people who have this natural resistance to the virus,"" The Daily Express quoted Professor Eckhard Thiel of the Charite University Hospital in Berlin, who led the research, as saying.,He added: ""We are convinced this treatment works. The patient we treated three years ago is perfectly healthy and we are sure the HIV virus has gone and will not come back. But we will want to carry out trials on other patients.,""Our patient is doing very well and is completely clear of the virus and living a normal life."",At present treatment will be limited as only three per cent of the world's population are immune from HIV.,But experts believe that they could take the bone marrow from a few donors and grow an inexhaustible supply of stem cells in the laboratory, thus treating many thousands of sufferers.,Details of the advance were revealed at the annual meeting of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation in Gothenburg, Sweden, and published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

With an idea to diagnose early HIV infection in women, children and TB infected people, the AIDS control organization is all set to expand its new testing technique — Whole Blood Fingerprick Testing Technique (WBFTT) — to front line workers.,The new rapid testing technique, trials of which were done last year is much easier and will now also be used by Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANMs), to test pregnant women at their door steps. ,""The status can be ascertained within 15-20 minutes and is much easier as there is no requirement of having to separate serum and red blood cells to test HIV. There is also no need to have a trained technician to use this method, which happens in case of the method used to separate serum"" said Dr Suresh Mohammed, national programme officer, Integrated Counseling and Testing Center (ICTC).,While ICTCs were introduced in India in 1997, there are many who don't go to the centers and get themselves screened. ""Out of the total estimated people living with HIV/AIDS in India, only 40-50 per cent know their status. We need to track the others. The whole idea therefore is to expand the testing so that more and more people can be diagnosed at the earliest,"" said K Sujatha Rao, secretary, AIDS control organization.,The trials of the new user-friendly technique have been conducted in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. Satisfied with the results, the AIDS control organization decided to expand it further. The organization at present is in the process of procuring testing kits. ,The WBFTT has been used in other countries and has resulted in more people getting tested for HIV. The AIDS control organization, from the year 2012, aims to test 22 million Indians every year for HIV.

Just like diabetics, HIV patients may soon be able to monitor their own condition at home using a hand-held device.,Researchers at three of London's largest research centres are developing a hi-tech, finger prick blood-testing gadget.,The device's tiny mechanical sensors – microcantilever arrays – measure HIV levels to warn of impending flare ups. A display then alerts the user if there is any need for them to visit a doctor.,""If patients neglect to take their treatments or need prompting to see their GP the device will provide a simple way of letting them know,"" the BBC quoted investigator Dr Anna-Maria Goretti, an NHS consultant and co-investigator based at the Royal Free Hospital, as saying.,""It will really empower HIV patients to keep a close eye on their health and their treatments,"" Goretti added.,Researchers said that apart from reducing visits to the doctor, the device could also be of real benefit in developing countries where rapid and affordable ways to monitor HIV patients are urgently needed.,The microcantilever arrays are each coated with substances that stick to the HIV and other proteins, which are markers associated with disease progression.,Lead investigator Dr Rachel McKendry of University College London and the London Centre for Nanotechnology, said that accommodating these markers causes the highly-sensitive sensors to bend like a diving board and this bend indicates the level of virus in the body.,""We have used microcantilever arrays to investigate drug resistance in superbugs such as MRSA, and are excited by the opportunity to extend this approach to detecting HIV markers,"" she said.,Dr McKendry has collaborated with researchers at the Imperial College London, Cambridge Medical Innovations, Sphere Medical Ltd and BionanoConsulting to develop the prototype hand-held device for clinical trials.

The ambitious scheme of the Central government to make youths aware of HIV/AIDS by establishing Red Ribbon Clubs (RRC) in education institutes in five ""A category"" districts of the state has taken a backseat. ,The clubs, aimed at making the youths aware about safe blood donation and control and prevent of HIV, is yet to come up. A scheme of the National AIDS Control Organisation, it was to be implemented last October in Allahabad, Banda, Mau, Devaria and Etawah — districts most prone to HIV. But the scheme is yet to see the light in Mau, Devaria and Etawah districts. A source in the state government said the scheme was being delayed because of the Lok Sabha elections. ,Though the Director of State AIDS Control Organisation (SACO), S P Goel, had written to the chief medical officers of these districts on October 23, 2008, to constitute the RRCs, not a single club has been formed yet.,Allahabad alone has over half-a-dozen premier institutes, four private engineering colleges and over a dozen degree colleges. But none have yet received approval for the club, said an official.,""We are trying to establish clubs at Allahabad Agriculture Institute Deemed University and Allahabad University. We had held talks with the vice-chancellors of these universities,"" said District AIDS Control Officer of Allahabad, Dr S A M Meesum.,Banda Chief Medical Officer M P Singh said he had asked the AIDS control officer to implement the scheme on a priority basis.

Five years ago, when the Shah family from Thane adopted an HIV-positive child from Society of Friends of Sassoon Hospital (SOFOSH) in Pune, those working in the adoption agency thought the tide had finally turned. But that first adoption remains the last from any such agency. ,What is raising fresh hopes is the trend of families adopting children of HIV-positive mothers. Over the past 10 years SOFOSH has successfully placed for adoption 103 children, born of HIV-positive mothers but themselves HIV-negative.,""Also significant is that unlike earlier, when only foreign couples would go for such adoptions, in the last 3-4 years local or NRI parents have taken this step,"" said Madhuri Abhyankar, SOFOSH director, who reads this as a change in acceptance level. ,Bhartiya Samaj Seva Kendra (BSSK) has seen about 25-30 adoptions of children of HIV-positive mothers in the last few years. ""The major concern adoptive parents have is that the child should not contract AIDS later. That's when our doctor explain to them that if the child is ELISA positive but tests PRC negative at age 18 months, it means he or she is like any other normal child. If anyone wants to take a second medical opinion we encourage them to do so. Once the family doctor says the same thing, the hesitation goes,"" said Maina Shetty, assistant BSSK director. ,No child's medical history is hidden from adoptive parents. ""Every month we have parent preparation workshops where remaining doubts are cleared,"" Abhyankar said.,Many children come from hospitals after the death of their HIV-positive mothers; many other afflicted mothers on their own give up their child after delivery.,Do parents tell the adopted child his or her mother's health history? ""That stage is coming now. The first such children who went for adoption from our home are nearing about 9-10 years of age now. This is when parents usually tell them that they are adopted which in itself is a big step. Adding the HIV information will call for sensitive handling. We are working with parents on how best to do that,"" said Sangeeta Pawar, SOFOSH adoption coordinator.

,,The first of its kind Old Age Home for people afflicted with HIV/AIDS, by the Government of Gujarat (GoG), now seems to have hit a stumbling block. The issue in question is that of the seven acres of land that was to be given for the said project. ,The Vadodara-based NGO, Lakshaya, which is headed by Prince Manvendrasinh Gohil, had mooted the idea to set up the home on the banks of the Narmada, at Kumbeshwar village in Nanod taluka of Narmada district.  ,Jayant Trivedi, an NRI, had given five acres of land in the same area for the project and had approached the state government for another seven acres of land. Gohil said: ""Six months ago, Trivedi donated his share at Kumbeshwar and approached the government for seven acres of land. The GoG agreed and asked Trivedi to undergo a few procedures."" ,The protocol was duly followed, but Gohil was recently told that the land belongs to the Forest Department. ,""Earlier, we were told that the land was declared waste and could be given for the Old Age Home. Soon after we approached the district administration, the area was fenced overnight,"" said Gohil.  ,He added: ""Trivedi has donated his five acres of land, and we will continue with the project, but not up to that extent. The figures of Lakshaya show that there are 50 HIV/AIDS patients in Narmada district alone. I am well aware of this fact that the district administration has fenced the land for afforestation. They will grow trees, but the survival rate is always a riddle. I support the concept of growing trees. The point is, how serious is the administration and why has it realised it suddenly."" ,Narmada District Collector R M Patel said: ""We are making roads for the forest dwellers in the Soolpaneshwar sanctuary area, and in lieu of that we have to grow trees in the other areas. The seven acres of land at Kumbheshwar is that piece of land that Lakshaya is claiming. We are trying to allot the land somewhere else."" ,Rajpipla Division Deputy Conservator of Forest (DCF) Sashi Kumar said: ""I had a meeting with the collector.

People with HIV infection are at greater risk of contracting the deadly swine flu virus and should be considered as ""priority population"" for preventive strategies, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said. ,According to the international health organisation, ""HIV people should be among those prioritised for anti-viral treatment with Oseltamivir or Zanamivir which shortens illness duration and severity of seasonal influenza. Individuals with advanced HIV infection may not mount an adequate antibody response to the influenza vaccine. They are one of the groups of people who can be affected more than people who are healthy."" ,Keeping in view their high vulnerability, the WHO has advised countries that their pandemic preparedness plans for influenza should, therefore, address the needs of HIV-infected persons, especially in high HIV prevalence countries. ,The WHO proposes to monitor this vulnerable group carefully as the virus spreads. However, India, which has a huge HIV-infected population, is waiting for the virus to erupt in India before taking any precautionary measure for this susceptible group. ,""There is no question of giving extra attention to the people with HIV infection when India is free from the virus. Let it reach and then we will see what has to be done for the HIV-infected people,"" said a senior official in the Union Health Ministry.,According to Dr B B Rewari, ART consultant with the department of AIDS control, ""while HIV-infected people are prone to all sorts of infections, they are as protected as anybody else is if their CD count is fine. HIV patients have been instructed accordingly for travel henceforth."" Meanwhile, 22 countries have so far officially reported 1,516 cases of influenza A (H1N1) infection.

With the number of HIV positive women on the rise in the state, the Uttar Pradesh Network of Positive People (UPNP), a motley group of HIV positive people with nearly 6,000 members, is organising a two-day convention to discuss the problems faced by the afflicted women.,There are 2,500 women members in the group, of which around 400 are widows left to fend for themselves by their in-laws. ,In the absence of any support like pensions or employment, many of them, tagging along their children, are fighting a battle for survival.,The two-day convention in Lucknow beginning Saturday will focus on the problems faced by the HIV positive women in the state. ""In India, being HIV positive is a social problem and not a medical one,"" says Ajita Yadav (name changed), a member from Allahabad.,There are horror tales the members recount. Meena Gautam (name changed) of Ghazipur was thrown out of house by her in-laws when her husband, working in a Mumbai factory, died of AIDS.,""They all held Meena responsible for his condition although it was the other way round. And when they realised even she is HIV positive, they made her an outcast. Meena now lives alone in another village and is doing menial jobs to support herself and her two children. ,She gets some medical support from the government but there is no nutritional support as she is very poor,"" says Anita Maurya from Ghazipur.,Similarly, Lakshmi of Gorakhpur (name changed) was also spurned out of her house after her husband, an HIV positive, died of TB. ,When Lakshmi tried to avail the benefit of the widow pension, she ran against a dead-end after losing her way through the bureaucratic maze. ,Tired and having lost all hopes, Lakshmi now lives with her 12-year-old son and does odd jobs to sustain herself and the child. ,""In case, HIV positive women decide to form a self-help group, they will be denied loans from banks for a variety of reasons,"" says Jahnabi Goswami, president of the Indian Network of Positive People. ,""We will be discussing problems like lack of employment opportunities, lack of support from government schemes and medical support for these women from the government agencies. We plan to take it up with the Union Health Ministry,"" she says.

Raghu (name changed), a labourer diagnosed HIV-positive, soon transmitted the virus to his wife and four children who were born later. Raghu's wife died of multiple infections but he remained unrepentant. He forced his children to beg and continued to visit prostitutes.,This went on till Raghu attended a health camp organised by devotees of Sant Tukaram during the annual palkhi. Here, he met counsellors of Positive Living Centre (PLC) and they helped him turn over a new leaf during a year of counselling. Raghu soon got a job as a security man and his children were enrolled in a municipal school.,Positive Living Centre (PLC) in Pimpri, set up by the Maharashtra Network of People Living with HIV (NMP+), has supported more than 3,000 such people. The project is funded and supported by Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM) and Population Services International (PSI), says Pravin Salunkhe, coordinator of the Samarth project at NMP+. ,It was set up initially in Pune and was later shifted to Pimpri. Mahadev Touti, counsellor in Pimpri, says the Pune project has been successful and is being replicated in Wardha and Beed districts.,Touti says the migrant population in Pune is huge and they are clueless about HIV testing facilities. ""Several NGOs in Pune are working in the field of HIV care and support. Hence we moved to Pimpri where PLC linked up with Anti Retroviral Treatment (ART) centre. PLC provides check-ups, monitoring, counselling, nutrition advice and drop-in facilities. We also have support groups and have started help generate income, with about 15 women having been given grants of Rs 5,000 to start businesses in tailoring, making agarbattis or plastic wrapping,"" says Touti.,PLC also counsels people on education of HIV-affected children. Around 800 children have availed of such facilities. The aim is to encourage healthy living says Shabana Patel, advocacy officer of NMP+.,In Wardha district, says Durga Samgirkar who coordinates the functioning of the newly started PLC, more than 300 HIV positive people have availed of the facilities. ""Nutrition is a major component here and we advise people on good eating habits,"" she adds.

Scientists have developed an HIV test which they claim works in just 30 minutes and can be performed anywhere in the world – no laboratory required.,An international team has developed the prototype CD4 rapid test, similar in design to a home pregnancy test, which works with a finger-prick blood sample to measure the numbers of CD4+ T-cells in a person's blood.,CD4+ T-cells are critical for a healthy functioning immune system and are slowly destroyed during the course of an HIV infection, thereby making patients increasingly vulnerable to illness.,According to lead scientist Professor Suzanne Crowe of Burnet Institute, the test enables patients at the point of care to find out within just 30 minutes if they should begin antiretroviral treatment without any laboratory equipment being required.,The majority of patients in developing countries start antiretroviral therapy based on symptoms alone. Research shows that if HIV patients wait till they're sick to start treatment they have a much poorer outcome than if treatment were started based on a CD4 count.,The majority of patients in the developing world don't currently have access to CD4 testing as it is expensive, and relies on sophisticated laboratory testing requiring specially trained operators.,Where testing facilities exist, it is often too difficult for people in rural areas to access them and it can take weeks to obtain results. Currently 33 million people globally have been diagnosed with HIV, many of them in resource poor countries.,And, having completed the first phase of trials, the prototype test developed by the scientists, in collaboration with colleagues at Rush University Medical Centre, Chicago and Duke University, North Carolina, will undergo further trials to ensure the assay offers reliable and reproducible results.

The 10 incidents of suicide by HIV positive people in Gujarat in the last two months, as against five-odd such cases across the state in the last five years, have caught the authorities by surprise.,Incidentally, all the recent cases of suicide involved people who were aware of their HIV positive status for a long time. Earlier, there were incidents wherein people took the extreme step as a knee-jerk reaction after coming to know about the disease. Experts see the sudden spurt in such cases as an effect of the global economic downturn. According to them, ,financial loss merged with the social stigma attached to HIV/AIDS is forcing people to commit suicide. ,Dr Rajesh Gopal, joint director (Blood Safety) of the Gujarat State Aids Control Society (GSACS), said: ""The number of suicides by HIV positive people in recent months is quite unusual. The main reason (behind committing suicide) in each case may be different, but it seems the economic slump has added to the social stigma attached to the disease, that finally ends in suicide."" ,Earlier this week, the Gujarat State Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS (GSNP+) and GSACS members held a meeting to understand and analyse the reasons behind the sudden increase in such cases.,Dr A M Kadri, joint director (Basic Services), GSACS, said: ""This kind of clustering of cases was not witnessed in the state earlier. In most of these recent cases, the patients had been undergoing treatment at ART (anti-retroviral therapy) centres. It certainly looks as if the economic slump has added to their mounting stress."",Kadri further said the GSACS is planning to strengthen its district-level support network, and identify psychologists and psychiatrists from government medical colleges who can help identify the patients with suicidal tendencies.,The most prominent among the recent suicide cases was reported in Vadodara two months ago, wherein an HIV positive family of four had taken the extreme step. It is believed that family head Deepak Panchal had suffered financial loss after he revealed his HIV positive status at his company. This led to the closure of the company. The mass suicide had come as a major shock to many, as the family had been actively working for people affected by HIV/AIDS. Pratik Rawal, GIPA (Greater Involvement of People with HIV/AIDS) coordinator with the GSACS, said that of the five cases reported in Junagadh, Vadodara, Surendranagar, Jamnagar and Bhavnagar, three had a direct connection to the economic meltdown. ,""Like the Vadodara case, suicides committed by a couple in Junagadh as well as in Jamnagar were driven by financial losses, as the individuals had lost their jobs and had to take up the work of a driver and garage worker,"" said Rawal.

In open violation of the guidelines of National AIDS Control Organization (NACO), the staff of state-owned Swaroop Rani Nehru hospital, a part of Moti Lal Nehru Medical College, brazenly pasted an 'HIV' sign on the wall behind the bed of a patient and refused him treatment.,The HIV positive man from Pratappur block, suffering from acute infection, was brought to the SRN hospital on Tuesday. The doctors initially refused to admit him, said sources. They relented only after the Allahabad Network for People Living with HIV Positive (ANP Plus) took up the matter with the district magistrate and the hospital administration.,The next morning, the staff wrote ""HIV"" on a piece of paper and pasted it on the wall behind his bed in surgical emergency ward. ,    When the attendants of patient objected and reported the matter to ANP Plus, the sign was removed on the instruction of Dr Amitabh Upadhaya, anti-retroviral officer of SRN hospital.,The staff then wrote ART (Anti-retroviral Therapy) on the wall and tied a red ribbon, the monogram of NACO, on the drip stand, said the relatives of the patient. ,Further, the doctors allegedly refused to treat the patient, saying proper medical kits were not available in the hospital.,The attendants of the patient and the members of NGO reported the matter to District Magistrate Rajeev Agrawal and Chief Medical Officer Dr PK Sinha.,""We were asked to purchase gloves and other items from outside. We also had to do the dressings of the patient,"" said Mangal Singh, the attendant.,On Thursday morning, fed up with the antipathy of the hospital staff and doctors, the family got the patient discharged and decided to go to the All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS), Delhi. ,The Superintendent-in-Chief of SRN hospital, Dr Shradhha Dwivedi, said she has ordered a departmental inquiry into the matter.

They might be paramedics, but the stain of social stigma binds them to silence. The highway town of Godhra, infamous as the epicentre of the 2002 riots, chooses silence when it comes to HIV/AIDS scare. ,Three paramedics working in the pathological laboratories are HIV positive. But their families know none of it, so much so that they opt to travel to Ahmedabad for treatment. ,The town, which is located on a national highway, and is also an important railway junction, is known for its population of truck drivers. ,According to Gujarat State Aids Control Society (GSACS), it has a high prevalence of AIDS. In the last one year, Panchmahals has reported 84 positive HIV cases of which Godhra alone accounts for 56. The total population of Godhra is just 75,000.,But more worrisome is the incidence of HIV positive susceptibility in pathology lab workers. The three affected paramedics, who are at present registered in the Integrated Counselling and Treatment Centre (ITCT) in Ahmedabad Civil Hospital, deny it is due to unsafe sex. ,They have said they discovered about their HIV positive status while doing tests in the laboratories where they work.,Kanti Meda (name changed), a 43-year-old laboratory assistant in Godhra who worked at a pathological laboratory owned by one of the leading pathologists in the city, contracted HIV two months ago. His children, parents and even his wife do not know that he is HIV positive. ,""It started with high fever and dry cough. I tested myself twice for the virus in the lab where I used to work but it turned negative. But tests at the Ahmedabad Civil Hospital, on the insistence of my boss, showed that I had contracted HIV (level 1). I stayed in the hospital for one week where they gave me medicines and told me that if I take it everyday, the virus will be under control and I will be able to work as well,"" he said.,He added that when he broke the news to his employer two months ago in April, they asked him to leave the job and take rest. ""It is disheartening because I worked for 30 years. Sometimes patients with maggots in their wounds come here to get their blood checked. No one is ready to dress up the wounds. I have collected so many such samples without even wearing gloves. Now, I can't tell anyone at home, although they keep asking why I sleep separately now,"" he said.,Elsewhere for Sunita Patel (27) and Deepa Rathwa (29) (names changed), nothing has changed since they were detected with HIV. ,They continue to work in the pathological lab where they were employed before. ""We work for three to four hours everyday. We have to visit Ahmedabad where we get the medicines every week. With this job, at least family members are not asking too many questions,"" added Deepa.,Sunita said: ""But sometimes when we get fever, our failing health becomes very prominent, which scares our parents."" The two are unmarried.,Meanwhile, Anup Amin, Assistant Director (Sexually Transmitted Diseases), GSACS said it is highly unlikely that health workers in the pathological labs could have contracted HIV from their work environment.  ""Health workers such as lab assistants contracting HIV is almost negligible as they are trained to handle any exposure to such viruses. It is for their safety, so a compromise on their part is highly unlikely. But, if the employers are not providing the doctors with proper pre and post exposure care, then it is an alarming situation,"" added Amin. ,According to GSACS, since working in pathological laboratory has its own occupational hazards, health workers such as lab assistants across private and government undertakings are given the requisite vaccination and medication before and after exposure to any potential carrier. ""These measures are uniform across government and private bodies,"" added Amin. Incidentally, there is no vaccine for AIDS. On their part, the laboratory owners said the laboratory assistants might have contracted the virus through multiple contacts. ,""Having multiple partners could be the reason why they contracted the disease. We provide them with adequate safety measures before and after exposure to the patients when they come for tests here,"" said one of the lab owners, where Meda worked for the last 15 years. ,But Meda refutes it saying that he was not even given gloves to collect samples from various patients.   Panchamahals Chief District Health Officer Prakash Vaghela said: ""It is possible especially in cases of private pathological labs to have these cases especially if the lab assistant is using improper syringes to conduct tests on themselves, which is routinely done to check for diseases, Godhra has a high incidence of AIDS in the state."" ,But Vaghela was unaware about such instances wherein lab assistants themselves have contracted the virus. GSACS officials said that Godhra's condition is worse than other major cities and towns in Gujarat.  ""Godhra is a like a transit point for truck drivers and others in the transportation business. It also has a high number of people migrating out of the town as labourers,"" added Amin.

Researchers at B J Medical College (BJMC) are facing a challenging task of identifying HIV positive babies and children, in the age group of six months to three years, who have not received any treatment so far. At least 21 are to be included in a multi-centric trial aimed at finding newer and effective HIV drug regimen.,Locating such babies and children for the study has become an extremely difficult task, say researchers at BJMC, the only medical college in the country selected by the National Institutes of Health, USA, to set up a Clinical Trial Unit (CTU) for multi-centric studies on HIV prevention in mother and child.,As per the national policy and National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) guidelines, the single-dose Nevirapine (NVP) remains a practical choice for prevention of HIV transmission from mother to child in areas with minimal medical resources, said CTU vice-president Dr Renu Bharadwaj. ""Without treatment, around 15-30 per cent of the babies born to HIV positive women will become infected with HIV during pregnancy or delivery."",Most HIV-infected pregnant women take at least one dose of NVP right before or during delivery and the baby also gets a dose of the drug. Researchers at BJMC, which has been one of the multi-centric sites for a trial on lowering the rate of HIV transmission to infants, are also raising concerns over the issue of drug resistance. ""There is a likelihood of children being resistant to the drug and who could react better to a combination of drugs,"" said Dr Nishi Suryavanshi, a scientist working with the project. ,A study has also been proposed as part of the International Maternal Paediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials Group with the mission to develop and evaluate a safe and cost-effective approach to the interruption of mother to infant transmission of HIV. ""We want to enroll at least 21 HIV children who have not been exposed to any drug. They will be involved in the clinical trial after parents or guardians give their consent,"" said Bharadwaj. ,The researchers are reaching out to civic and private hospitals and NGOs apart from tapping rural doctors in their search for infants and children (6 months to 3 years), who are HIV positive and have not received any treatment. ""We are appealing to paediatricians who treated sick babies and HIV-positive mothers who had not received any treatment, so that the children can be registered for the project,"" said Bharadwaj. ,The National AIDS Research Institute, Pune, and the Tuberculosis Research Centre, Chennai, too had faced a huge challenge in enrolment of volunteers for the AIDS vaccine trial. ""It is very difficult to enlist volunteers. But the process is under way and phase 1 of the trial has begun,"" say top scientists at both the institutes.,In Chennai, the TRC banked on Y R G Care centre to conduct meetings with the communities and get more volunteers. A total of 32 volunteers are required (16 each at NARI and TRC) for phase 1 of the trial. ""We are nearing completion of enrolment,"" the scientists said. The trial uses a DNA-based vaccine candidate ADVAX to prime the immune system.

Five months after the Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS) invited proposals for standardising HIV testing facilities at public and private medical centres, the society is finding it difficult to rope in maternity homes because of the minimum 50 deliveries a month criterion set by National Aids Control Organization (NACO) for maternity homes. ,In its first attempt to standardize HIV testing in both public and private hospitals, clinics, maternity homes and private laboratories, NACO, had invited proposals from private medical centres. ""We have been given a target of 24 maternity homes apart from other medical centers to train their counselors and technicians and also provide test kits. However, most of these maternity homes fail to meet the requirements set by NACO,"" said Dr S S Kudalkar, project director, MDACS.,He added, ""NACO in its national guidelines has set a criterion that allows only those maternity homes that have conducted at least 50 deliveries a month. Only three maternity hospitals including Wadia Hospital in the city fulfill the criteria. Maternity homes are an integral part of the programme as they can prevent mother to child transmission of the disease."",Twelve private medical centers including hospitals, maternity homes and nursing homes in the city have come forward to participate in this government scheme and to start Integrated Counseling and Testing Centers (ICTC) that provide free HIV testing facilities and counseling for patients. However, MDACS has been unable to rope in more private maternity homes. Over two months back MDACS had written to NACO urging them to relax the rules for Mumbai as the city has a problem of space. ""There are many maternity homes willing to participate but they conduct only 30 deliveries a month on an average,"" said Dr Kudalkar.,Hospitals like Safiee Hospital on Churni Road, Prince Aly Khan Hospital in Mazgaon, Nowrosjee Wadia Maternity Hospital in Parel and a couple of other small maternity homes and hospitals in Malad, Goregaon, Mulund and Mahim have already signed a memorandum of understanding with MDACS, apart from five Family Health International's Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) clinics and two Population Service International clinics. ""Last month when NACO chief had come down to Mumbai for a review meeting we had again put forth the issue but are yet to get any response,"" said Dr Kudalkar.,NACO decided to standardize HIV testing in private maternity homes and hospitals as nearly 35 per cent of mothers delivering in the state approach private hospital for healthcare.

But here is a doctor in the city who advertise frequently about his claim of curing these patients. This way he is exploiting these patients."" ,The NGOs gave a memorandum to Deputy Commissioner Vikas Garg demanding that HIV positive/AIDs patients be saved from exploitation. ""Such persons are violating the Drugs and Magical Remedies Act -1954 (objectionable advertisement) through such false claims. So a case should be registered against him and his licence should also be cancelled,"" the memorandum demanded.

Seven-year-old Pintu Jana (name changed), a thalassaemia and HIV-positive patient, is untraceable. Needing regular blood transfusions and medication, the resident of Jhargram cannot be located either by the state Health Department or NGOs who have been assigned by the Government. ,However, Jana's is not a solitary case. As security forces and Maoists lock horns in trouble-torn Lalgarh and adjoining areas, more than 60 HIV-positive people, part of the programme of the National AIDS Control Society, many of them critical and undergoing anti-retroviral therapy (ART), cannot be reached by health workers.,""We cannot trace a single patient in the Jhargram-Lalgarh area. As part of the national HIV/AIDS programme, we not only provide medication, counselling and care but each patient is checked on a regular basis and we have to keep track of them. For the past seven days, none of the critical patients can be contacted,"" says Ranjan Sourav Das, project coordinator of the community care centre.,In collaboration with the Government, the centre sends health workers to each of the HIV patients' house. Now that has stopped.,""Many of them are critical and on ART. They cannot be traced and no one can reach them. I am more concerned as there is a food shortage and HIV-positive people cannot cope with that,"" says Dr Anindya Sen, in-charge of the NACO ART Centre at Midnapore Medical College Hospital.,According to records, seven-year-old Jana, son of a shopkeeper in one of the remote villages of Jhargram, has been suffering from thalassaemia since his birth. During routine blood transfusions, he also caught HIV. Referred to the community care centre for treatment, he underwent transfusion and got treated for infections related with HIV before leaving for home last month.,""We are very concerned. He needs blood transfusion and regular check-ups. But for the past 14 days, we cannot contact them,"" said Das. ""Our community centre has 10 beds. Nine of them are empty now. The one patient we have, ironically, is supposed to go back home. But he is stuck here."" ,Jibon Mahato (name changed), a 44-year-old HIV-positive patient, is restless to return home to Belpahari. On ART, he was discharged last week, but no one could come to take him back. ,""I do not know about Maoists or police. I want to go home. After I was diagnosed with HIV, my wife left me. My brother does not come near me. But my mother takes care of me. There is no news of anyone from my family,"" says Mahato, breaking down.,Tarot Chakraborty, board member of the Indian Network of Positives, a NACO-partnered organisation of AIDS victims, said: ""The Government should take steps to do something for these people and all other patients who are there. These people should be immediately traced."",There are others suffering too. All five high schools in the Lalgarh area have now been shut for days. Some have been occupied by security forces, others are housing relief camps. While Bhadutolla Vivekananda Uccha Vidyalaya has been shut since June 14, Pirakata High School, Bhimpur High School, Lalgarh High School and Ramgarh High School are closed since June 17. The two dozen primary schools too remain locked.,""Roads have been dug up and blockades put up. But still I tried to go to school, only to find it locked. Later, a relief camp opened there. I do not know when this will end,"" says Sukhen Mahato, a Class X student of Pirakata High School.,""I could not collect my admit card from college. My first-year examination is slated for July 1... I am sure I will lose an academic year,"" says Pinaki Roy, a resident of Lalgarh and a first-year student of Midnapore College. ""There are so many like me here. There are Madhyamik (Class X) passouts who are yet to reach colleges in Midnapur and take admission."",The Lalgarh Block Development Office, which was shut for the past two months, only opened the day before yesterday after security forces reached the Lalgarh police station. For two months, all government work remained suspended.

In two months, the National Aids Control Society (NACO) will roll out its alternative first-line Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) regime for HIV infected patients in the country who are developing a toxicity due to treatment using first-line drugs.,Newsline had first reported about the revised national guidelines of NACO to incorporate the alternative treatment regime in the free first line drugs already provided at ART centres in the country.,""NACO has finished the tendering process and soon all the 10 centres, including JJ Hospital in Maharashtra, will be able to give alternative treatment,"" said Dr Rekha Jain of Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (MSACS).,The news comes as a relief to about 150 HIV patients across Maharashtra who are resistant to first line treatment and are taking second line treatment at private hospitals.,The news about the alternative treatment was announced at a first of its kind public hearing on the 'importance of second line ART drugs' where People Living with HIV (PLHIV) from across the state gathered to sensitise policymakers and civil society organisations about the importance of second line ART drugs. ""Most of the patients on first line treatment are developing resistance to anti-HIV drugs. Second line treatment is available only at JJ Hospital. Not all patients can travel as they are weak and resort to private practitioners,"" said Pravin from Network of Maharashtra by People Living with HIV (NMP+).,""Most of these patients need alternate drug therapy rather than second line drugs,"" said Dr Ramesh Devkar, project director MSACS.,""Increasingly, toxicity of ART is becoming an important issue in the management of patients with HIV. The first line ART treatment has improved the CD4 count (used to assess a person's immune system) and has decreased the incidence of opportunistic infection. But with continued use, the complications of treatment are being seen,"" said Dr Alaka Deshpande, in-charge of the ART centre at the J J Hospital, the largest in the country. ""Despite toxicity, permanent and proper adherence to the therapy is needed to maximise its long-term benefits,"" Dr Deshpande added.,According to doctors, approximately 10 per cent of patients on the first line of ART treatment are developing toxicity to drugs. Although adverse reactions to the therapy are common and profoundly affect its clinical efficacy, many such reactions are poorly studied, analysed and under-reported, say doctors.

Intense awareness campaigns and right counselling at the community level helps reduce the risk of HIV and AIDS, reveals a study by Population Council and its partners. The study conducted in Mumbai's slum pockets suggests counselling to curb HIV, extra- marital sex and alcohol abuse.,According to the findings, extra marital sex among men reduced from 12.5 per cent in the year 2002 to 2.9 per cent in 2006. Also prevalence of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) among married men dropped from 3.2 per cent in 2002 to 1.7 per cent in 2006.,The study carried out among married men with high-risk behavior, has shown that awareness campaigns can indeed curb the spread of HIV. The study was conducted as part of the RISHTA project in three large slum settlements of Mumbai-Mankhurd, Cheeta Camp and Bainganwadi- between 2002-07 by the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS) in partnership with several other Indian and international organisations including TN Medical College attached with BYL Nair Hospital and the University of Connecticut. ,The findings of the study were published in the June edition of American Journal of Community Psychology. ,""About 2,400 married men were interviewed from the community in the baseline and about 2,700 in the end line- with a subset same in the base line, to arrive at the findings,"" said Dr Niranjan Saggurti, project director HIV AIDS section, Population Council, Delhi. Partner violence has also shown a drastic reduction with an increase in marital sexual satisfaction and gender equity. ,""Since STIs often preceded HIV, the RISHTA project focussed on reducing STIs through a range of community-based activities such as street theatre, counselling and the involvement AYUSH doctors in the narrative prevention counselling programme developed by IIPS,"" said Dr Sagguti. ,Experts involved in the project say that the findings have thrown up facts that can be used for planning more campaigns to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. Urging a more inclusive approach, Saroj Pachauri, Population Council's Regional Director for South & East Asia, said, ""The project has demonstrated that to bring about lasting change among communities it is important to work at multiple levels."" ,Population Council and its partners have now taken up the second phase of the project in the same cluster of slums with a focus on protecting married women from HIV-AIDS.

The proposal for constituting a high-level investigating committee to probe the incident of an HIV positive woman being labelled and reportedly paraded in the Guru Gobind Singh Government Hospital in Jamnagar is yet to take the final shape. ,The proposal will be finalised on Tuesday after the Health Commissioner approves it. The committee will submit its report within seven days of its formation. ,Meanwhile, questions abound about the five-member committee that was formed at the Jamnagar Hospital to probe the incident. No action has been initiated against anyone ever since the incident took place on Saturday except that three of the staff members have been asked to proceed on leave.,Now, with the formation of the high-level committee, the five-member committee will automatically be dissolved. ,Dr Pradeep Kumar, the Additional Project Director of Gujarat State AIDS Control Society (GSACS), said, ""Once the high-level committee is formed, the hospital committee will automatically stand dissolved, as the government wants to make the committee comparatively broad based."" ,The five-member committee includes the Additional Medical Superintendent, a professor of the TB and Chest Department of the hospital, a matron of the hospital, a member of District Level Network of people living with HIV and AIDS, and a member of the Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS). ,Meanwhile, the Health Department, which is at present, finalising the high-level committee, is of the opinion that the 'unfortunate incident' has marred its efforts to create awareness and work for HIV positive and AIDS patients. ,Dr Kumar said: ""The person responsible for the incident should and will definitely be punished. But unfortunately, this isolated incident has taken away the credit of all the work done for the cause of HIV and AIDS by the state government. It is really unfortunate that even as Jamnagar and moreover the same hospital has had a past record of commendable work in this field, this kind of incident occurred."",Eyebrows are now being raised over the inquiry ordered by the state Health Department into the Saturday's incident at the Guru Govind Singh Government Hospital in Jamanagar. People in the medical fraternity feel that the superintendent and the medical officer, who were present at the time of the incident, should be held responsible for negligence on their part. But the superintendent has been made the investigating officer of the case, they have said. ""The nurse, who stuck the label, is working directly under the guidance and control of the medical superintendent. And, he is the prime person responsible as the head of the hospital and controlling authority,"" said a doctor in the Jamnagar Government Hospital. ,""He should not be part of any investigation team. In fact, he should be investigated for negligence, harassment and insult to the patient and denial of treatment for a very long time,"" he added. ,Incidentally, the name of the medical officer in the Gynaecology Department, who was present at the duty, reportedly doesn't figure in the inquiry. ,""The incident occurred when Ranjan Thakkar (Vithlani), the medical officer, Gynaecology Department was on duty. But her name has also been struck off from any inquiry,"" he added.,When confirmed about Dr Ranjan as to whether she was on duty when the incident happened, Dr B D Gupta, Medical Superintendent, said, ""Our investigation found that she did not have any role in the incident."" Asked how can he head the investigations, he said, ""We cannot talk to you, it is a violation of the code.""

Authorities at the Guru Govind Singh Government Hospital, Jamnagar, put an 'HIV-positive' sticker on the forehead of a 25-year-old pregnant woman and paraded her in the hospital in the presence of her six-month-old daughter and mother-in-law on Saturday. ,According to health activist Nisha Jani of Jamnagar District Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS, the woman had visited the hospital on Wednesday. Dr Nalini Anand, the head of gynaecology department, and Dr Dipti Joshi examined her. ,Her medical examination revealed that she was in the second month of pregnancy, and since she was HIV-positive, she was advised to abort. Accordingly, the woman, accompanied by her daughter and mother-in-law, visited the hospital on Saturday morning for the abortion.,The woman told social activists later that nurse Prafulla Ramani had pasted the label with HIV-positive written on it, asking her to stand separately from the queue. It was a health activist who spotted her moving with the label and alerted his colleagues.,After the blood reports came, alleged the woman, the doctors and other staff ""humiliated"" her by sticking the label on her forehead and paraded her in the hospital. She claimed that the doctors refused to treat her. Meanwhile, Dr Anand described it as an ""unfortunate incident"" and apologised to the patient. ""It should not have happened.

The number of new HIV infections in the state has fallen over the years but that of AIDS-related deaths has risen, with most of the victims having got infected years ago. Doctors fear the death count will rise further in the near future.,Latest figures released from the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) reports 886 deaths in 2008, down gradually from 395 in 2005.,In contrast, the HIV positivity rate, or the percentage of people who prove HIV-positive from those who have undergone tests at integrated counselling and testing centres, has gone down from 6.79 per cent in 2005 to 4.64 per cent in 2008, reports the Economic Survey of Maharashtra 2008-09, an indication of better management of the disease.,""AIDS as an epidemic is maturing. New infections have gone down steadily but HIV infections acquired before the advent of ART drugs are now maturing to the stage of AIDS,"" said Dr Alka Deshpande, in-charge of ART (Anti Retroviral Treatment) at JJ Hospital.,Dr Deshpande said it takes about 10 to 20 years for HIV infections to develop into full-blown AIDS. At this level, the patient has low immunity levels and opportunistic infections could lead to death.,The National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) began giving free ART in 2004, with JJ Hospital being one of the first centres selected. The ART programme, which began in eight institutions, is now in 197 ART centres across the country and giving free treatment to 120,000 patients, including 20,000 from Maharashtra.,Last year, when NACO introduced a second line of drugs, it estimated that, despite very good adherence levels, nearly 3 to 5 per cent of patients become resistant to antiretroviral drugs after about three years of treatment. It estimates that close to 3,000 persons taking ART across the country have become resistant and need to be moved on the second line of drugs. ,Yet, Dr Deshpande said, ""There will be more deaths because of drug resistance. At the same time with the introduction of second line drugs, longevity will improve."",Doctors say that patients die not of AIDS but of opportunistic infections (OI) acquired with lowered immunity. Because of this, AIDS-related deaths are also under-reported. ""AIDS is not a notifiable disease. People with AIDS die because of OIs and hence many deaths are not reported as due to AIDS. This happens especially in villages,"" said Dr Deshpande.,HIV specialist Dr J K Maniar said that earlier tuberculosis was the only OI associated with HIV but now there are a host of others such as herpes, fungal meningitis and toxoplasmosis. In Maharashtra, 15-20 per cent HIV-positive people are found to have TB, one of the most common OIs. ,""Patients do not die of AIDS. They die because AIDS reduces immunity, which invites secondary diseases that become the cause of death,"" said Dr Basant Bagdi, additional project director of MSACS.

The number of pregnant women opting for HIV/AIDS tests is increasing over the years. As per data, the six government hospitals attached with medical colleges in the state had tested 26,688 pregnant women for HIV/AIDS in 2007-2008; 34,265 women in 2008-2009; and 4,536 pregnant women in April and May this year.,According to state government figures, in 2007-08, of the 26,688 women, 184 tested HIV positive, and 84 of the deliveries happened in government hospitals. Similarly, in 2008-2009, out of 34,265 women, 212 tested HIV positive, of which 173 deliveries were conducted in the six hospitals. Again, for the months of April and May of the 2009-2010 period, 42 women tested HIV positive out of which 30 deliveries happened in the hospitals. ,The additional project director of Gujarat State AIDS Control Society (GSACS) said: ""The government has been putting immense effort in dealing with HIV related cases. If we compare last two years' records, the number of tests of pregnant women has increased tremendously."" ,Officials also said that the mishandling of the HIV positive woman in a Jamnagar hospital is an isolated case. The Guru Gobind Singh Government Hospital in Jamnagar, where the incident had occurred, incidentally, has a fair record in handling such deliveries. ,According to GSACS records, in the year 2008-2009, the hospital had conducted as many as 8,112 HIV tests on pregnant women, and out of 16 HIV positive pregnancies, 14 deliveries happened in the hospital. For the two months of April and May of the year 2009-2010, over 1,300 tests have been done, and one delivery has happened in the hospital.

,
Ever since the HIV virus was discovered in 1983, a lot of research has been done around its genome. In the face of emerging and re-emerging viral threats, large-scale genome sequencing efforts are underway to monitor viral evolution in real-time. To fully appreciate the mechanisms of viral adaptation and evolution, and to also develop reagents and resources for a better molecular diagnosis of viral infections, there have been efforts at producing full-length viral genome sequences.,Research has shown that HIV drug resistance can be identified by genome sequencing. Hence it is important to study the influence of the changes in the HIV genome. At the National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) in Pune, scientists are just six months away from completing the sequencing of the HIV genome. And according to Director Dr R.S. Paranjape, initial trends show that the Indian virus is slower in its progression than the South African Sub type B and C. The Indian subtype C strain of HIV is different from the subtype C strain in China and South Africa, he explained. ,NARI has been working on this project for two-and-a-half years and has sequenced 60 strains in the country. ""What is the genetic make up of the virus? How has it evolved? How can the evolution go further? These are the issues being looked at. A large number of samples from patients, stored away for years, is being analysed and we are looking at evolutionary trends,"" says the director.   ,Dr Jayanta Bhattacharya, who is also working on the project, says genome sequencing basically means to read the genetic makeup of a given virus strain. The genetic sequence of HIV is obtained by amplification (through polymerase chain reaction) of the integrated provirus in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or from the HIV + plasma and subsequently reading the DNA sequences with the help of a genetic analyser.,The study is funded by the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India, and has documented and published papers on novel forms of B/C recombinants in India. Subtype C is the predominant strain of HIV circulating in the country. The prevalence of recombinant strains (such as B/C, A/E and A/C) are far lower than subtype C and its implication in the progression of the disease has not been fully understood, says Bhattacharya.,In the process, an HIV repository has been created as researchers have screened additional HIV-1 strains for disseminating their near-full-length genetic properties. These virus samples are from patients who acquired the infection as early as 1998 or recently transmitted infections. The repository is the only one in India with strains collected from different parts of the country and containing different subtypes. These would be useful for scientists to test their anti-virals, vaccine and microbicides.

The Network of Maharashtra by People Living With HIV (NMP+) has expressed shock at the treatment meted out to an HIV positive woman at a Gujarat hospital. ,A statement issued by Shivaji Barge, president of the NMP+, has reiterated the need for an HIV/AIDS bill to curb such discriminatory practices.,The woman in her mid 20s was in a state of shock after being diagnosed as HIV positive. On the advice of doctors, she terminated her pregnancy in order to prevent the possibility of her child being born positive. In this fragile condition, the hospital authorities put a sticker, saying HIV+, on her forehead. The staff of the local Network of Positive People, who were present in the hospital, happened to see her with the sticker on and complained to the hospital superintendent, the statement said.,It is disappointing to see that doctors and nurses, who are educated and have responsibility towards people in need of medical help, demonstrate such discriminatory practices. It exposes their ignorance and prejudice. The only way to prevent this is to pass the long pending HIV/AIDS bill, Barge said, urging the health authorities to look into the issue.

In view of the recent incident in Jamnagar, in which a nurse had labelled a pregnant woman as 'HIV positive', the Gujarat State AIDS Control Society (GSACS) plans to start sensitisation workshops for health workers and officials to handle HIV+ patients. Initially, these will be held in Surat, Vadodara, Jamnagar and Ahmedabad. Moreover, as part of the social marketing project of GSACS, 2,000 condom vending machines would be installed with the help of parallel organisations working for HIV positive patients. ,Out of 86 HIV positive cases in the Panchmahals district, 56 are in Godhra alone. Dr P K Vaghela, the chief district health officer of Godhra, said that 36 new condom vending machines would be installed in the town. ""We have issued a circular to all health officials in the public and private sector to take extra precautions, such as gloves while conducting tests on HIV patients and follow necessary protocol in handling them by keeping their identities secret,"" added Vaghela. ,Newsline had recently reported about health workers in private pathological labs contracting the virus. ,Dr Pradeep Kumar, Additional Project Director, GSACS, said: ""As part of the social marketing project, condom vending machines with premium quality contraceptives would be installed. For this, users will be charged in cities such as Vadodara, Ahmedabad, Surat and Jamnagar."" ,The plan to set up new condom dispensers was decided before the Jamnagar hospital incident, Kumar said. ""However, keeping in mind that incident, we are also starting the sensitisation workshops for all health officials and workers starting with cities and then move to the rural areas with the aid of parallel organisations,"" he added. ,Meanwhile, the officials said that although smaller towns are on the radar, bigger cities such as Ahmedabad and Surat have higher number of cases in the state. ,Gujarat, Kumar said, has 1,38,000 people living with HIV out of about 24 lakh people tested positive in India.

No patients will be enrolled for AIDS treatment after 2016, the Botswana government has stated. The reason: funds have dried up. Similarly, the Mozambique government did not get money from the Global Fund this year. Investments in the National TB and HIV programs of Uganda, Zambia and Tanzania have also been cut back.,In the backdrop of the global recession, more than 5,000 AIDS researchers, implementers and community leaders gathered in Cape Town for the 5th International Aids Society (IAS) Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention warning of dire public health consequences resulting from a retrenchment in the global fight against AIDS. The IAS conference focuses on converting scientific research into practice. But due to the fall in funding by international agencies, the scientific community is becoming increasingly concerned. ,""I am greatly frustrated by the lack of commitment to universal access to HIV prevention and treatment at the recent G8 Summit. The global financial crisis is not an excuse to weaken our determination to fulfill these commitments. If we don't move forward, we will rapidly lose ground,"" said Dr Julio Montaner, IAS president, inaugurating the conference on Monday. ,Disappointed at world leaders retreating on previous commitments to universal access to HIV prevention and treatment, community activists warn that the epidemic will spiral out of control, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. ""We can have all the knowledge and research but the bottomline is money. In the next 12 months, the people of Africa are going to see severe cutbacks in HIV funding. Most African nations do not have funds for basic interventions. The lives of millions of people in Sub-Saharan Africa are in jeopardy because of the lack of political will,"" said Paula Akigizibwe, regional treatment advocacy coordinator at AIDS and Rights Alliance for Southern Africa. ,Sub-Saharan African has 68 per cent of the world's HIV-positive people but only 1 per cent of the global expenditure on health, and 2 per cent of the global health workforce. Currently, only one-third of HIV-positive Africans in need of antiretroviral (ARV) treatment can access it, according to Treatment Action Campaign (TAC).,Earlier this year, Tanzania was the first Sub-Saharan country to announce a 25 per cent cut in its annual HIV/AIDS budget. This was soon followed by Botswana's announcement that the government will not be able to include new patients in its free ARV programme from 2016 onwards.,""All this stands in direct contradiction to a commitment to set aside 15 per cent of their national expenditure towards health made by African heads of state during a meeting in Abuja, Nigeria, in 2001,"" added Akigizibwe. ,With the UN target of universal access by 2010 on the horizon, health experts maintain that if funds dwindle, we will be in a situation similar to the 1990s, where millions died because they could not afford treatment.

Six English Premier League players are allegedly awaiting results of HIV tests after it was reported that a girl whom they had bedded was infected with the virus.,According to reports, the players were shocked to know about the virus and were suggested to take HIV tests in order to confirm whether they have contracted it. ""All of them are beside themselves with worry. They are all only too aware of the scandal it will cause. None of them have let their families know yet because they don't want to worry them,"" The Sun quoted a source, as saying.,The players, believed to be from three different clubs, were not named due to legal reasons and to avoid public humiliation. ""It's like a ticking time bomb for them all and would almost certainly end their careers if they have contracted it,"" the source added.  ,Apparently, the girl has no idea whether she contracted the virus before or after sleeping with all of them. The infected girl had met them through her boyfriend and it is believed that after splitting up with him, she slept with the players over several months. After finding out that she was HIV positive, it is also believed that she informed all her sexual partners about her condition.

,
Last year, Tihar Jail became the first and only prison in the country to start screening prisoners for HIV/AIDS. Exactly a year later, jail authorities are grappling with their disconcerting findings. Tihar has ""an astounding number of HIV positive inmates"", they say. ,As many as 140 inmates tested positive for HIV. At present, 63 of them are in the prison compound.,According to senior Tihar officials, the decision to set up a testing centre was taken after jail authorities detected the increasing incidence of drug abuse. ,Jail officials maintain that Tihar, with 11,500 prisoners, has the highest inmate strength in South Asia. ""It had become imperative, therefore, to start conducting the tests. We had earlier assumed that there would be 15 or 16 HIV positive prisoners, but there was no way to know for certain,"" a senior official said.,In June 2008, Tihar set up its ICTC or Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre with the help of the National Aids Control Organisation, to carry out HIV/AIDS tests in jail. Out of the 1,709 prisoners screened for HIV in one year, 140 prisoners tested positive. Since then, a number of these prisoners have either been released or are on parole, bringing the number of HIV positive inmates within the prison walls down to 63.,""There is always a steady stream of prisoners moving in and out, so their numbers keep fluctuating,"" said Tihar spokesperson Sunil Gupta. ,Gupta added they have been able to identify such a high number of HIV positive inmates for the first time. ,According to the ICTC test reports, 93 out of the total 140 inmates who had tested positive, were drug users. Gupta said it was only since the launch of ICTC that jail authorities have begun providing medical treatment on a war footing, now armed with confirmed medical reports. ,""It is an alarming revelation because there are around 300,000 inmates in prisons all over the country and if drug abuse is not controlled, HIV/ AIDS would become a huge problem as most of the HIV positive cases in Tihar are drug addicts,"" said a jail official. ,""Earlier, inmates were sent either to the Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital or some other hospital for testing outside the jail premises — this too was sporadic. But now, they all are tested here in the ICTC and then provided counselling,"" said B K Gupta, Director General, Tihar Prisons, adding that tests could only be conducted with the consent of the prisoner. ,Tihar and Rohini Jail, which is also in its jurisdiction, have at present around 11,500 prisoners. The total number of inmates who are drug addicts is 1,750. Officials said around 83 per cent of these prisoners — that is 1,439 prisoners — are repeat offenders.  ,Apart from medical treatment, jail authorities are also providing de-addiction camps under a new programme called OST (Opioid Substitution Treatment), also initiated by the prison.

Guardian Minister Dileep Deshmukh said the administration is thinking of making a separate provision for children affected with AIDS in Latur.,As reported earlier, 10 children suffering from the disease are staying in the Ashram Sevalaya in the village, run by Amhi Sevak, an organization serving orphans and children inflicted with the disease.,The affected children were admitted in the ZP school due to which parents of 148 children out of the 240 have stopped sending their children to the school.,Education Minister Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil had on Friday ordered a probe into the matter and directed the Latur Collector Ekanth Dawale to submit report within two days.,Deshmukh, after meeting the villagers said it is not proper to take action against the parents.,""The parents are afraid that their children will also be affected by AIDS. We will think of making some separate provision for these children. We will also try to discuss the matter with the Chief Minister and do our best to sort out the issue amicably,"" Deshmukh said. ,Reacting to Deshmukh's statement, Director of the 'Sevalaya' Ravi Bapatley said, ""It is the society that has given me the land and the money to run the organisation and the ashram for the AIDS and HIV-affected children. These children have very short life and even in this shorter span of life should they be kept away from the society?"",Kaustubh Vikas Amte of the Anandvan, established by Baba Amte, also visited the Sevalya in the Hasegaon village.,""On one hand, government is spending crores of rupees for AIDS awareness campaigns and on the other hand it is thinking of keeping such children separately out of the society, this is contradictory to the government's policy,"" Amte said.

Dozens of people living with HIV across the state have sought the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) to retain the treatment and counselling centres  (TCCs) attached to the five anti retroviral therapy (ART) centres.,While the counsellors at these centres are themselves HIV-positive, the organisation is in the process of appointing professional counsellors at the ART centres. At present, around one lakh patients receive not only ART treatment at these centres but also counselling for their personal problems. ,""The only reason I was motivated to continue the ART treatment is the inspiration I drew from the counsellors who are themselves HIV-positive. They put forth their examples on how they lead a normal life and this really works. Also they are more patient with us and answer all our questions, even helping us fill the forms in English,"" says Reshma who receives ART treatment at Sasoon Hospital, Pune.,Activists and patients point out that globally those living with HIV are increasingly being involved in policy and official advocacy measures on HIV. They say that relocating the existing peer counsellors at the ART centres is against the global norm.,Yogesh, another patient who receives treatment at JJ Hospital, agrees. ""Professional counsellors do attend to us, but they are burdened with the rise in number of HIV patients at the ARTs. They do not guide us well at times."",The TCCs were started in July 2006 in the five ART centres in the state, of which three are located in Mumbai. These centres proved to be a bridge between networks for HIV-positive people in the community and ART centres. At the TCCs, one peer counsellor (an HIV-positive person) and two medical social workers offer counselling and referral services as per need.,""The TCCs were beneficial to HIV patients as they used to refer us to trusts where we can get assistance for educational and nutritional purposes,"" Reshma said.,""Ironically, when the world is implementing Greater Involvement of People Living with HIV/AIDS (GIPA) principles, giving upperhand to the involvement of the HIV-positive people in policy and decision-making, the NACO is not giving enough space to HIV-positive persons,"" says Hemant, a peer counsellor at KEM Hospital. Hemant was detected with HIV seven years ago.,Meanwhile, the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) claims that the centres will not be closed down, though the existing peer counsellors are to be replaced by another set of HIV-positive persons. ""These peer counselors will now do more of outreach work at district-level networks. We are appointing care coordinators in their place who are also HIV-positive,"" said Dr Rekha Jain of MSACS.

Hiv-infected people availing a 50 per cent concession in second-class train fares to travel to nominated Anti Retroviral Treatment (ART) centres for treatment will now be referred to as ""Immuno Compromised"" and not ""HIV/AIDS infected"".,The Railways Ministry through a recent order decided to make this change to protect the HIV-infected people from the stigma attached with the disease.,""We have been asked by the Health Ministry to make this change. What has prompted this decision is a realization that branding a category of people as 'HIV/AIDS infected' while granting them a concession was not only exposing them to social stigma but was also being thought of as derogatory,"" a senior Rail Bhavan official told The Indian Express. Sources said instances of discriminatory behaviour by co-passengers towards those availing this concession had already been reported ever since the concession was introduced.,The Railways Ministry has now directed all concerned to immediately get these changes incorporated in the Passenger Reservation System, the manual ticketing system, the Self Printing Ticket Machines and the Unreserved Ticketing System. All the 16 zonal railways have been asked to arrange the necessary revision of the certificates issued to those availing the concession. ""The existing certificates will, however, continue to be accepted till the new certificates are printed,"" the order said.,The ministry has also asked the Health Secretary to advice the concerned ART centres on this. The order also extends the validity period of the concession certificate for the Immuno Compromised people from three months to six.,In last year's rail Budget, the then railway minister Lalu Prasad Yadav had announced a 50 per cent concession in second-class passenger fares for HIV-infected people traveling to 123 nominated ART centres.,This concession is admissible in basic mail/express fares only and not in other charges like reservation fee, superfast surcharge and development surcharge, which are still recovered in full.

Unhappy with the state's inaction on treatment facilities for HIV positive prisoners, the Bombay High Court on Thursday imposed a cost of Rs 5,000 each on the Inspector General of Prisons, Additional Chief Secretary of health department and Director General of health services.,The officers will have to pay the sum from their own pockets.,As per earlier court directions, the three officers were supposed to hold a meeting, and submit a report to the court as to what steps would be taken for treatment of HIV positive inmates.,However, despite court orders to this effect on June 22, no report was produced before the court on Thursday.,The HC had taken up the issue in 2008 while hearing the bail plea of a prisoner serving life sentence at Pune's Yerawada Jail. It was pointed out that in a span of five years (2001-2006), 32 HIV positive prisoners at Yerawada Prison had died. It was alleged that most of the prisoners died due to lack of proper treatment and care.,Last month, the court was informed that HIV positive patient, who was seeking bail, died after contracting TB.,On Thursday the division bench of Chief Justice Swatanter Kumar and Justice S C Dharmadhikari was told that the government wants to appoint a special counsel and therefore the matter be adjourned.,The division bench noted that in 1997, the high court had asked the state to set up a special prison hospital but no steps were taken in this direction till date., ""We hear many bail applications where convicts seek bail so that they can get treatment for HIV. Some of them died with the application still pending,"" the judges noted.,The court observed that the government failed to provide necessary infrastructure for treatment of HIV positive inmates.,The state government had earlier told the court that they have devised a system whereby individual health files of inmates of four central jails in Maharashtra will be maintained for better detection of HIV positive cases.,They submitted that the suspected HIV positive inmates will be segregated. They will then be examined by the court-appointed committee comprising Dr Alka Deshpande, head of anti-retroviral therapy at J J Hospital and the project director, Maharashtra State AIDS Control Organisation (MSACO). ,The matter will come up for hearing after a week.

Scientists have developed a ""molecular condom"", which they claim is actually a vaginal gel that would help protect women from contracting the deadly HIV during sexual intercourse.,According to them, before sex, women would have to insert the vaginal gel that turns semisolid in the presence of semen, trapping AIDS virus particles in a microscopic mesh so they can't infect vaginal cells.,""The first step in the complicated process of HIV infection in a woman is the virus diffusing from semen to vaginal tissue. We want to stop that first step. We've created the first vaginal gel designed to prevent movement of the AIDS virus. This is unique. There's nothing like it,"" said lead scientist Prof Patrick Kiser of the University of Utah.,""We did it to develop technologies that can enable women to protect themselves against HIV without approval of their partner."",According to the scientists, due to cultural and socioeconomic factors, women often are unable to negotiate the use of protection with their partner.,""So we developed a vaginal gel that a woman could insert a few hours before sex and could detect the presence of semen and provide a protective barrier between the vaginal tissue and HIV. We wanted to build a gel to stop HIV from interacting with vaginal tissue,"" co-scientist Julie Jay said. ""It flows at a vaginal pH, and the flow becomes slower and slower as pH increases, and it begins to act more solid at the pH of semen.""

,

,
European scientists have discovered a new strain of the virus that causes AIDS and linked it to gorillas, creating a mystery about when and how the first patient found to have the strain became infected.,This could be the first time scientists have documented the jump of a simian immunodeficiency virus to humans from a gorilla. All three other known strains of the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV-1, have been linked to chimpanzees. But genetic tests showed that the new virus was closely related to a recently recognised gorilla virus.,The most likely explanation for the new virus's emergence is gorilla-to-human transmission, probably a result of humans slaughtering apes or handling or eating their meat.,But the scientists said they could not dismiss the possibility that the chimpanzee virus linked to HIV-1 was transmitted to gorillas and then to humans, or was directly transmitted to humans and then to gorillas.,The new virus strain was isolated in 2004 from a 62-year-old woman upon her arrival in Paris from Cameroon in West Africa. She has not been treated for AIDS and has no signs of the syndrome, the scientists said.,The woman had lost weight in 2003 and had been ill with a fever a number of times, the scientists said in reporting the discovery, in the August 2 issue of the journal Nature Medicine.,Her husband died in 1984 from a stroke. It is not known if he was infected with HIV. The woman had six children, all born before 1980, a year before doctors first recognised AIDS; two of the children died of noninfectious causes, and none of the surviving children have HIV. ,The authors of the report said they presumed that she had been infected through sex. The woman told her doctors that she had sexual partners in Cameroon after her husband's death. ,The amount of virus in her blood is high, reported the French and British team led by Jean-Christophe Plantier of the University of Rouen in France. But the number of CD-4 blood cells, a key laboratory measure of the progression of AIDS, is stable at about 300 per cubic millimeter.

A photograph taken and posted on a travel website by an unknown foreigner nearly drove Thilakavathy, a 25-year-old mother, to suicide and landed Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (Tansacs), which used the picture showing Thilakavathy and her then two-year-old daughter in hundreds of hoardings and posters for an HIV awareness campaign, in court. ,Justice Suguna of the Madras High Court, hearing Thilakavathy's plea for relief and compensation, directed Tansacs to draw up guidelines for using photographs from the Internet and ordered removal of all hoardings and posters with the photo within a week.,The High Court agreed with Thilakavathy that the ads, with captions suggesting she was an AIDS patient, ""were a serious problem that will affect the social status of the family"". Thilakavathy had pleaded the ads have made relatives and neighbours distance themselves from the family and in the beginning made even her husband ""suspicious"" of her.,Justice Suguna later directed Thilakavathy's counsel to implead the private advertisement agency as a party to the case. Final judgment on her demand for a compensation of Rs 1 crore and unconditional public apology from Tansacs will be pronounced after a month.

The Indian Armed Forces' policy on HIV prevention has been revised to incorporate a salient feature. Henceforth, HIV-infected pregnant wives of Armed Forces personnel will be given a cocktail of drugs from the sixth month of pregnancy to prevent the transmission of the virus to the infant. ,This is for the first time in the country that such a move has been proposed to curb HIV transmission. However, recruits will continue not to be screened for the virus while joining the forces.  ,The AIDS control programme of the Armed Forces has been a success story with the present prevalence rate being just 0.1 per cent. In fact, it is the AIDS Control Organisation in the department of community medicine at Armed Forces Medical College that has been guiding the AIDS control programme in the armed forces. ,The revised policy, however, prefers to adopt a high index of suspicion towards the incidence of the virus as the prevalence rates are higher among personnel of BSF, CRPF and DSC than the Army.,Major General Mandeep Singh, Additional Director General, Armed Forces Medical Services (medical research), who has been on the forefront of the AIDS control programme in the forces, told The Indian Express, ""As part of expansion of our HIV surveillance programme, the policy is to give a cocktail of anti-HIV drugs to the pregnant woman from the sixth month,"" he said. The present policy is to give the drug nevaripine to pregnant woman while she is delivering the baby. ,Armed forces are a vulnerable high-risk group because of their youthful profile and separation from families. There has been a steady decline since 2003, when AIDS was the cause of 170 personnel being declared invalid every year, to merely 15 now. An increased surveillance programme had led to an exponential increase in the number of cases detected then. The detection rates peaked in 2000 and then began to plateau out, he said.

Agreements between former President Bill Clinton's foundation and two drug companies will lower prices on medications for patients with drug-resistant HIV in the developing world.,One agreement, with Mylan Inc., lowers the annual price of four antiretroviral drugs that are used as a second line of treatment when patients develop a resistance to the first drugs they are treated with.,The other agreement, with Pfizer Inc., reduces the cost of a medication that can be used in conjunction with the drugs in patients who have tuberculosis.,The agreements would help drugs ""reach hundreds of thousands more people and save hundreds of thousands of morelives. This is a very big deal,"" Clinton said on Thursday in announcing the deal.,Clinton said Mylan, through its subsidiary Matrix Laboratories Limited, would bring the annual cost of the antiretroviral drugs atazanavir, ritonavir, tenofovir and lamivudine down to under USD 500.,Starting in 2010, the pills will be packaged together and sold as something patients can take once a day, for an annual price of USD 425. The Clinton Foundation said that price is 28 per cent lower than the current lowest-priced alternative.

,
,


,
Washington Scientists have developed a ""molecular condom"", which they claim is actually a vaginal gel that would help protect women from contracting the deadly HIV during a sexual intercourse.,According to them, before sex, women would have to insert the vaginal gel that turns semisolid in the presence of semen, trapping AIDS virus particles in a microscopic mesh so they can't infect vaginal cells. ""The first step in the complicated process of HIV infection in a woman is the virus diffusing from semen to vaginal tissue. We want to stop that first step. We've created the first vaginal gel designed to prevent movement of the AIDS virus. This is unique. There's nothing like it.,""We did it to develop technologies that can enable women to protect themselves against HIV without approval of their partner,"" said lead scientist Prof Patrick Kiser of the University of Utah. ,According to the scientists, due to cultural and socioeconomic factors, women often are unable to negotiate the use of protection with their partner. ""So we developed a vaginal gel that a woman could insert a few hours before sex and could detect the presence of semen and provide a protective barrier between the vaginal tissue and HIV. We wanted to build a gel to stop HIV from interacting with vaginal tissue.,""It flows at a vaginal pH, and the flow becomes slower and slower as pH increases, and it begins to act more solid at the pH of semen,"" co-scientist Julie Jay said. The scientists estimate that if all goes well, human tests of the gel would start in three to five years, and the gel would reach the market in several more years.,The findings of their experiment testing the behavior of the vaginal gel and showing how it traps AIDS-causing HIV particles are to be published in the upcoming edition of the 'Advanced Functional Materials' journal.

A new study has shown that nerve cells can naturally protect themselves against HIV infection.,The natural resistance to HIV is triggered by a protein called FEZ-1, which is made uniquely by neurons, and appears to keep off the virus.,The research team from University College Dublin, Ireland insists that the findings have raised the possibility of new treatments to inhibit HIV with the help of gene therapy or drugs to activate production of the same protein in cells other than neurons – especially the white blood cells that are most vulnerable to infection.,Lead researcher Mojgan Naghavi along with her colleagues Juliane Haedicke and Craig Brown determined the protective effects of FEZ-1 protein by blocking its production in human neurons.,The researchers hope to establish if they can block HIV infection in white blood cells by genetically engineering them to produce FEZ-1. ,They also hope to have deeper insights into how FEZ-1 blocks HIV.,""We know FEZ-1 blocks infection, but we need to find the basic mechanism,"" New Scientist quoted Naghavi as saying.,Scientists know that FEZ-1 bind to molecular ""motors"" that help to transport proteins within cells along internal tramlines known as microtubules. ,According to Naghavi, FEZ-1 might get in the way, thus blocking transport of viral proteins into the nucleus where they would multiply.,However, the only other source of natural protection against infection is in people who can't make CCR5, a surface protein that HIV uses to gain entry to cells.,There certain drugs that block CCR5, and other teams are testing gene therapies to restock patients'' blood with cells engineered to not produce CCR5. ,The study appears in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Almost a month after their parents refused to let them attend school with HIV positive classmates for fear of the deadly virus, scores of village children in Maharashtra's Latur district have begun trickling back to classes, apparently reassured by a door-to-door campaign by activists and local authorities.,At the peak of the scare two weeks ago, parents had demanded the infected children be removed from the school and when the authorities refused, they stopped sending their wards to the government-run institution in Hasegaon village. The attendance in the 248-student school had then dipped to 48. On Wednesday, it had risen to 175, officials said.,They said the effort to counter the fear of the villagers saw local activists organising a protest rally against the discrimination on July 21. A day later, activists decided to approach villagers directly and clear their misconceptions about HIV/AIDS. There were door-to-door visits, including to the house of the village sarpanch, senior residents and influential people. The efforts seemed to work as the attendance rose to 107 on July 22.,""The sarpanch and senior villagers were willing to listen to us. The good part was that the attendance improved,"" said Ravi Bapatley, director of Sevalaya, a local voluntary group involved in the campaign.,The campaign also saw the involvement of the health department, which is spreading awareness through local village health officials. The villagers had initially resisted information and directives from health officials from the cities. ,Activists said that they will watch the situation until the end of July before planning their next move.,The protest began after nine children from Sevalaya AIDS ashram in Latur were given admission to the district primary school in June. ,Their presence in school triggered resentment, with parents of other children withdrawing their wards. In the village of 4,000, where rumours travel fast and information on HIV/AIDS travels slow, residents didn't want their children to study with children with HIV. The villagers had even passed unanimous resolutions opposing the presence of HIV positive children in the district school.

The Centre is spending crores of rupees for awareness and prevention of HIV AIDS in the country, but the disease continues to spread its wings in UP.,According to latest surveys of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), there are 1.25 lakh HIV-positive people in the state and 40 per cent of them are women. ,According to the surveys, this the ""worst positive male-female ratio"" in the country. The situation has led the Indian Network of Positive People (INP Plus) to launch an exclusive project to provide peer support to women in UP. ,Of the 40 per cent HIV-positive women in the state, three to four per cent are unmarried adolescent girls and 30 per cent are widows, who have lost their husbands to AIDS. ,The highest number of positive women is reported from districts like Mau, Deoria and Allahabad — the high prevalence areas — and Ghazipur, Jaunpur, Siddharth Nagar, Ballia, Varanasi and Banda. ,Worse, very few of the HIV-positive women receive medical aid and support, as experts blame it on social stigma. ,Pratap Vikram, project manager for the INP Plus' Strengthen Abilities to Manage and Respond Effectively to HIV/AIDS (SAMARTH), said: ""AIDS is synonymous with social stigma. And for a woman, the stigma is even more. While women are way behind on the development index, being HIV-positive pushes them further down."" ,Anupam Raizada, team leader of the Technical Support Unit of Uttar Pradesh State Aids Control Society (UPSACS), said it must be brought home that instead of women, men are the carrier of the virus. ,""Many women do not get medical aid because they do not dare to step out with their positive status. In fact, many of them may blaming themselves for the disease,"" Raizada said.,Pratap Vikram said though the number of positive women was high, there is no specific programme for them. ,""The state needs a programme that focuses on their livelihood support as most of them, especially the widows, have been deserted by their families. We also need a programme to sensitise men about the problems women face,"" he added.

French virologists said they had found a new subtype of the AIDS virus that appears to have jumped the species barrier to humans from gorillas.,The new strain, found in a woman from Cameroon, West Africa, is part of the HIV-1 family of microbes that account for the vast majority of cases of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), they said.,Until now, all have been linked to the chimpanzee.,The new subtype has been called P, adding to three established HIV-1 subtypes -- M, by far the most prevalent, and O and N, which are rare.,There is also an HIV-2 which is a minority viral family and is also suspected to have origins in non-human primates.,The virus was sequenced from a blood sample taken from an unnamed 62-year-old woman who moved to Paris from Cameroon, according to a letter published by the journal Nature Medicine.,In 2004, shortly after moving to the French capital, the woman was tested for HIV. She responded to diagnostic tests for HIV-1 but further tests failed to pinpoint the viral subtype.,The virus was genetically decoded and then put through a computer model to compare its evolutionary past against known viruses, both HIV and its equivalent in apes, called simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV).

In a significant judgement for the HIV community in Maharashtra, the Bombay High Court has instructed the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) to provide free treatment to all HIV positive people who need 2nd line drugs. The treatment will be provided through the State AIDS Control Society (MSACS). ,In response to a public interest litigation submitted by the Network of Maharashtra People with HIV (NMP+), Chief Justice Swatanter Kumar and Justice A M Khanwilkar noted that 'the competent authority has taken a decision to provide free-of-cost appropriate treatment to the petitioners, who are allegedly suffering from HIV. The judgement was given last week. ,At an earlier hearing, when NACO pleaded that they could not afford it, the judge insisted that they provide treatment, saying he would order the state government to give them adequate funds to cover it. Second Line drugs are essential for survival of many people with HIV. These are people for whom the normally available treatment for HIV, 1 st line drugs, have failed, cause too many side effects, or are no longer effective. These people need an alternative (that is, 2nd line or Alternate 1 st line) treatment, says Pravin Salunke Coordinator of the Samarth programme at NMP+. ,The government criteria by which people can access 2nd line have been too prescriptive. Patients have been assessed not on clinical need but on such factors as whether they had previously received paid-for treatment, or the number of years they have been on 1st line. Many poor people who do not fall into the Below Poverty Line category have had to devastate their finances to buy the drugs or go without and face the risk of death, adds Vincent McDonald, Communications Advisor at NMP+. ,Second line drugs cost approximately Rs 6,000 a month. Around 100 people have been receiving free treatment at JJ Hospital in Mumbai, The NMP+ has been conducting an advocacy campaign on this issue for many months. The Human Rights Law Network has helped them with the litigation in the court. NMP+ believes there are over 200 people who need 2nd line in Maharashtra. Of the 30 petitioners in the original court litigation filed in March, at least six have died.

In a major breakthrough, scientists are hopeful of creating an AIDS vaccine after finding two powerful new antibodies that bind to a ""weak spot"" in the Human Immunodeficiency Virus. Researchers at International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), at the Scripps Research Institute in California, and at biotechnology firms Theraclone Sciences and Monogram Biosciences published the discovery in the journal Science this week.,The two new antibodies — ""broadly neutralising antibodies"" or bNAbs — are the first to be identified in more than a decade and to be isolated from donors in developing countries, where majority of new HIV infections occur. Though the antibodies were found in samples in Africa, the findings are important for India as the subtype of virus circulating in both regions are similar. ,Few people with HIV produce these antibodies in abundance, so scientists must find a way to induce their production.,Unlike previously identified antibodies, which function by binding to places on the virus that have proven difficult to exploit by means of vaccine design, findings on the new antibodies show great potential. Unlike other antibodies, bNAbs can block infection from many kinds of HIV.""Now we may have a better chance of designing a vaccine that will elicit such broadly neutralising antibodies, which we think are key to successful vaccine development,"" said Dennis Burton, Scientific Director of the IAVI Neutralising Antibody Center. ,IAVI's vaccine trials  are conducted primarily in Africa and India. In India, IAVI has  partnered with Indian Council of Medical Research with trials in Pune and Chennai. ,""There is a lot of work to be done, but the discovery of these two antibodies and the vulnerability of HIV that they reveal gives researchers impetus,""said Rajat Goyal, Country Director, India International AIDS Vaccine Initiative. ""A number of researchers in India will be involved in working to translate these finding into immunogens, the active ingredients in vaccines.""

,

,
,


,
Nearly 8 per cent of around 50 HIV patients in an out patient department (OPD) setting in Pune are infected with Hepatitis B (HBV), a study by the Institute of Infectious Diseases (IID) has found. The viruses Hepatitis B (HBV) and Hepatitis C (HCV) and their co-infection with HIV are a source of increasing concern as HBV and HCV lead to cirrhosis, hepato-cellular-carcinoma and end stage liver disease. This has led experts in the city to call for an effective screening mechanism in order to provide early treatment. ,Dr Sanjay Pujari, director of IID and assistant professor of Infectious Diseases, University of South Florida, Tampa, USA told The Indian Express that HBV affects more than 2 billion people worldwide with 350 million chronic carriers. In fact according to Dr Dileep Wani, director of Jan Kalyan blood bank and member of the State Blood Transfusion Council, there are 6-8 per cent of healthy blood donors who show HBV reactivity and HBV alone is more of a dangerous virus than HIV. ,Screening of donors at blood banks is particular about people who have had multiple sexual partners and other criteria as HBV is transmitted through the sexual route, blood transfusion (injections) and mother to child (trans placental) route. Since both the Hepatitis B virus and HIV virus share similar transmission routes, it is not surprising that there is a high frequency of co-infection, says Dr A Risbud, scientist at National AIDS Research Institute (NARI). ,Pujari further points out that conditions associated with hepatitis B and C are currently among the leading causes of hospital admission and even death in the HIV infected population. Hence, adequate management of hepatitis B and C is now being considered a priority in HIV co-infected patients, says Pujari who has organised a seminar on the topic on September 13 at Poona hospital. ,Despite an effective vaccine the estimated worldwide mortality is 0.5 to 1.2 million deaths a year. The WHO estimates that about 170 million (3% of the world population) people are infected with HCV. Because of the shared routes of transmission co-infection of HBV and HCV with HIV is extremely common. It is important to evaluate for all the 3 viruses in patients presenting with mono infection with one of these viruses. ,There have been important advances in understanding the virology and natural history of HBV and HCV infections. This has translated into development of newer treatments and strategies for managing these infections. However, numerous uncertainties and controversies surround the management of HBV/HCV/HIV infection. The seminar will also focus on the need for screening of these patients. Dr Vinay Thorat, Dr S K Sarin from New Delhi, Dr Abhiit Chowdhury from Kolkata  will participate in the HIV- hepatitis co-infection seminar.

When ""XYZ"" (identity withheld) went to a Delhi government-run clinic earlier this year for a cataract surgery for his left eye, he was denied treatment. ,On Tuesday, the 50-year-old man, who had tested HIV-positive, found the government itself fixing up an appointment for him with the medical superintendent of the same eye clinic that had sent him away: ,Guru Nanak Eye Centre, the eye department of Maulana Azad Medical College.,What brought around the quick turnaround for the former driller with an oil company is that he moved the Delhi High Court after a six-month struggle to get his left eye treated.,Senior Delhi government counsel Najmi Waziri told the court on Tuesday afternoon that the government ""does not discriminate against any citizen who has HIV. The petitioner (XYZ, as named in the petition) may present himself in the chambers of the medical superintendent at 9.30 am on Saturday"". ,Justice Sanjeev Khanna, who was hearing the matter, agreed to the arrangement.,The High Court Chief Justice had earlier in the morning referred the matter to Justice Khanna's court.,XYZ had told the court that the hospital had ""misbehaved"" with him. Challenging the hospital's behaviour, he demanded ""compensation"" for the alleged violation of his fundamental right to medical treatment.,He put the eye centre, unit in-charge Dr P K Pandey, Principal Secretary (Health and Family Welfare), the Delhi government, and the Delhi State AIDS Control Society as parties in the litigation.,According to the complainant, he was retrenched from his job after being diagnosed HIV-positive between December 2006 and January 2007, and he could not return to his native village due to this.,With a son in Class VII, the petitioner said he could not afford to lose his eyesight after his eye was affected since he was the family's sole earning member. ,On February 3, he went to the MAMC's eye centre for the first time and was diagnosed with cataract which ""required an operation"".,The petition stated that he was referred to Lok Nayak (LN) Hospital for ""clearance"" as he belonged to the category of 'people living with HIV/AIDS' for whom the procedure was required from a specialised hospital before being subjected to surgery.,After tests at LN Hospital, he was sent back to the centre for cataract surgery on April 9. ,On April 21, the centre's staff admitted him. But the very next day, the petition stated, he was discharged without surgery and again referred to LN Hospital for ""continuing treatment for AIDS"". ,His discharge slip read ""continue anti-diabetic and anti-retroviral therapy"". ,On May 5, the petition said, the eye centre went on to ""neither admit nor conduct surgery"". ,The complainant, who had filed his petition through advocate Divyajyoti Jaipuriar, submitted, ""No surgery of my cataract was conducted till date.""

,

,
,
,

,
In a breakthrough, researchers have for the first time have found a vaccine that cuts HIV infection by more than 31 per cent, giving fresh boost to the global fight against the dreaded disease.,The experimental drug cuts the risk of HIV infection by a third in the world's largest AIDS trial of more than 16,000 volunteers in Thailand, researchers said.,It is the first time after two decades of human trials that a vaccine has stopped the virus infecting 7,500 across the world every day.,""It gives me cautious optimism about the possibility of improving this result and developing a more effective AIDS vaccine"", Anthony Fauci, director of the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases was quoted by Washington Post. Colonel Jerome Kim, led the study for the US Army, which was also involved in the trial, said, ""It is the first evidence that we could have a safe and effective preventive vaccine."",The vaccine, a complicated mixture of six ""prime"" and ""booster"" shots, is the first positive result after two decades of experimentation.,""Conceptually, we now know a vaccine is possible,"" said Fauci, adding, ""Whether the vaccine is going to look anything like this one I don't know. But at least we know it can be done."" ,The trail run for the vaccine for the last six years has been jointly conducted by the US Army, the Thai Ministry of Public Health, NIAID institute, and two other patent holder companies.,The finding is statistically significant with 31.2 per cent effectiveness but scientists seldom consider licensing a vaccine which is less than 70 or 80 per cent effective.,Instead, the chief benefit of the ALVAC-AIDSVAX vaccine is that it can give fresh insights into the human immune system specially when a person is protected from HIV.,""We really need to go through the data to see if there are effects here that are potentially useful,"" said Kim.,, The world's largest test of a potential AIDS vaccine, sponsored by the U.S. Army and conducted by the Thailand Ministry of Public Health., 16,402 HIV-negative Thai men and women ages 18 to 30 at average risk of infection. Half got vaccine and the rest received dummy shots., A two-vaccine combo, ALVAC-AIDSVAX, from Sanofi Pasteur and the nonprofit Global Solutions for Infectious Diseases., The vaccine lowered the risk of becoming infected with HIV by more than 31 per cent - a modest benefit that scientists hope to improve.

Stressing on the fact that HIV/AIDS is penetrating deeper into the rural set-up, the Health department has now sounded an alert at the taluka level for prioritisation of talukas for Targeted Intervention programmes. ,Out of the total 226 talukas in the state, the Health department has classified 27 talukas as high risk prevalence 'category A' and 29 others as moderate risk prevalence 'category B'.,The department made this classification on the basis of a three-month (April, May and June) review of the HIV status in various talukas. ,The prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Gujarat is 0.38 per cent. ,State Health Commissioner Dr Amarjeet Singh has issued a circular to all District Collectors, District Development Officers and Chief District Health Officers, emphasising on the need for the effective implementation of different components of the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP) in the high-risk talukas. Around 95 Targeted Intervention programmes for HIV are being implemented across the state by the Gujarat State AIDS Control Society (GSACS) at present.,""As per the analysis of the Targeted Intervention programmes, talukas in Bhavnagar, Bhuj, Mehsana, Morbi, Rajkot, Surat City, Vadodara and Valsad are performing well in terms of coverage, but require improvement of quality and linkages with local health system. ,""Out of the 27 HIV high prevalence places, the performance of ICTC centres located in Jamnagar and Valsad districts has been average, whereas utilisation of centres in Talaja, Gandhidham, Wadhvan and Pardi is below satisfactory level,"" the circular reads.,Meanwhile, the performance of Amreli, Dahod, Gandhinagar, Narmada and Sabarkantha in terms of coverage in STD control is unsatisfactory. Bavla, Sanand, Palanpur, Bhavnagar, Una, Nadiad, Gandhidham and Pardi require greater focus, it adds.

,
This year's Diwali could be special to 25 HIV orphans of Mamata Foundation if its initiative to get them 'adopted' by city-based families, albeit for a few days, succeeds. Instead of distributing firecrackers and sweets, the foundation looks to give these HIV-positive kids the experience of what Diwali is all about.,According to Amar Budukh, founder of the Mamata Foundation that provides a residential facility along with nutritional diet, counselling and education for 25 HIV orphans, it is efforts like these that will eventually get them in the mainstream. ""Most of these children come from various parts of Maharashtra and have lost both their parents to AIDS. Some are as young as three years while the oldest is 11 years old."" ,Says Dr Milind Bhoi, founder of the Bhoi Pratishthan, ""We have appealed to families to 'adopt' these children just for a few days so that they can celebrate Diwali with them at home. Right from wearing new clothes, sharing sweets, playing with firecrackers and exchanging greetings, at least for a few days, these children who have been orphaned at a tender age can partake of Diwali celebrations by spending time with the regular families.,The organisation is looking to start 'placing' these children from Thursday as they already have a few families lined up for the short-term adoptions. However, they want to send out all the children out to their foster homes together even if it means holding back some of them who have their destinations ready, by a few days.,Meanwhile, at the Society for Friends of Sassoon General Hospital (SOFOSH), there are 30 children with special needs who are still waiting to be adopted. Says Madhuri Abhyankar, Director of SOFOSH that runs Shreevatsa Orphanage, ""We are planning a cycle rally and other events with the help of Indian Medical Association and others to encourage people to adopt the children with special needs. This will be done during the adoption week from November 14 to 21.,""These children have diseases like HIV, thalassaemia, growth hormone deficiency and cerebral palsy. All these years, they have never been adopted and hence we want to sensitise people to help give them a loving family. For Diwali this year, college students have specially decorated the ward at Shreevatsa at Sassoon Hospital that houses these children,"" says Abhyankar. A minimum of Rs 250 is spent daily on the child's upkeep, she adds.,Mamata Foundation has urged celebrities and administrators like the Mayor to adopt a child for a few days and contact Budukh at 9860195909.

,
A city court held last week that an HIV-positive man could not make his disease an excuse to deny his estranged wife and children financial maintenance.,Directing the man to pay alimony to his wife and his school-going children, Metropolitan Magistrate Twinkle Wadhwa said: ""Though the court is sensitive to the difficulty faced by the man, who is an HIV patient... but when the question of maintenance is to be decided, it is to be decided from the point of an established legal framework.""  ,The judge also observed that it was the court's duty to ensure the woman and children were not pushed to poverty on the sole ground of the ailment. ,She said: ""A man cannot be exculpated of his legal, social and moral liability to pay maintenance to his wife and children... only because he is an HIV patient."" ,The court said all it could do for such ailing people was to consider their expenses on treatment while deciding on the quantum of alimony.,Referring to a Delhi High Court judgment, the magistrate noted that the onus was absolutely on a person to prove to the court that for reasons beyond his control he was unable to earn enough to provide for his estranged wife and children. ,Otherwise, he could not be exonerated of his duty to pay, the court held.,In this case, the woman filed the petition, seeking alimony for herself and the two children. Married in November 1990, the couple soon developed problems, allegedly because the husband and his family put pressure on her for more dowry.,She left her in-laws' place and approached the court last year for alimony after the husband refused to support them.,While the woman said she had no means to feed her family, the husband said he could not either because his ailment did not allow him to earn. ,Magistrate Wadhwa, however, observed that there was no evidence to establish that the man was bedridden and hence unable to earn. Moreover, had the children been staying with him, he would have had to maintain them despite his ailment, she further noted. ,The court then computed his income under The Minimum Wages Act and ordered the man to pay Rs 1,200 every month as support to his children.

The Chandigarh State AIDS Control Society launched a 27-day HIV/AIDS awareness programme on Tuesday in association with the HLL Lifecare Limited. A function including skits and cultural performances was organised to promote awareness among the truck drivers. Senior Superintendent of Police SS Srivastva, who was the chief guest on the occasion, flagged off a condom awareness van which will move around in the city for 27 days and distribute free condoms to the public. Dr Vanita Gupta, project director, SACS, Chandigarh, said truck drivers were the vulnerable to contracting the deadly disease since they stay away from their homes for a longer time periods. ""Sex is a biological need and some of them happen to fulfil it when they indulge in unsafe sex with HIV infected sex workers. It is, therefore, necessary that they know about safe sex,"" she said. Gupta said that there were 8,000 HIV affected persons in Chandigarh and about half of them have full blown AIDS, indicating at the efforts to reduce the rate of infections even though she said that it had stabilised. SSP Srivastva also praised the society for holding the function at a place where it mattered the most rather than holding it at elsewhere.

Those employed in angadia services (local courier network) from Mehsana district have come under the radar of high-risk behaviour for HIV/AIDS, district health department officials claimed. As per the survey conducted by health department, Mehsana district ranks second in terms of high-risk prevalence of HIV/AIDS. ,Carrying out antenatal tests, surveys were conducted in 2006, in which prevalence of HIV/AIDS was found in every one of 100 persons of the district. ,Sources said many newly-wed youths work, who for angadia companies and stay away from home for long. Many of them have sexual relations outside their wedlock. ,""There are two kinds of surveys — qualitative and quantitative. We focused on group discussions under the quantitative survey, where we found that those working for angadias are one of the most vulnerable groups getting HIV/AIDS,"" said health officials. ,The network of angadias is not only restricted to the state but also the metros including Kolkata, Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai. There are more than 100 Angadia companies  in Mehsana district alone and they also export diamonds through  angadia services.,While Mehsana Chief District Health Officer Dr D C Jagani refused to comment on this issue, he did not rule out high prevalence of HIV/AIDS among angadia workers of this region. ,HIV/AIDS programme coordinator, Mehsana, Dr I R Solanki said: ""It is true that the incidences of HIV/AIDS are high in this profession.  However, we cannot disclose the numbers which is against the law of National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO). Moreover, the prevalence has decreased to 0.17 per 100 persons this year. When more than 5 per cent prevalence of HIV/AIDS is found in a group or a community, then it is considered under high-risk behaviour."" ,Officials added that initial tests are conducted at Mehsana Civil Hospital and then the cases are diverted to Integrated Centre for Testing and Counselling (ICTC). ,Mehsana-based NGO Young Citizens of India Charitable Trust (YCICT) is helping the patients and their families to rehabilate them. ""Care is taken that their names are not written in the records of ICTC so that anonymity is maintained preventing stigma against any person,"" a health official added. ,Even the Gujarat state AIDS Control Society is taking interest in the matter.

For the first time in the country, insurance products tailored to meet the specific needs of HIV/AIDS patients and their families will be introduced in Gujarat. This has come following a joint study by the Institute of Public Health, Bangalore and the Gujarat State Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS (GSNP+) in a bid to change the way families of HIV/AIDS patients manage costs. ,The study titled 'Feasibility and Needs Assessment Study for a Health Insurance Cover of HIV Positive and Families in Gujarat' has been carried out in 24 districts of Gujarat. ,The findings will document the healthcare needs of people living with HIV, the expenditure involved and the coping mechanisms. ,At present, HIV patients in India have to either depend on subsidised healthcare facilities—which only cover treatment costs—in terms of nutritional supplements, or have to rely on donations. The HIV/AIDS affected are not covered by the general medical insurance products in the country.,Dharmendra Patel, coordinator at GSNP+ said, ""An HIV positive person has to spend as high as Rs 5,000 per day, which includes Insurance shield for HIV patients, families to battle disease the cost of nutritious food and medicines that he is required to take.""  ,According to the findings, most of the respondents favoured an insurance product and are ready to pay a premium between Rs 50 and 1,500 per annum. Almost 99 per cent of the survey population showed an interest to join the health insurance scheme.,The findings led to some of the insurance companies tying up with GSNP+ and the Gujarat State AIDS Control Society (GSACS) to come up with insurance products specially tailored for such people. GSACS Director Pradeep Kumar said the study findings were discussed with insurance companies interested in such a specific need-based health insurance product.,Shriram Life Insurance Co Ltd, a joint venture between the Chennai-based Shriram Group and Sanlam, South Africa's largest life insurance player, has announced that it will bring an insurance policy for people suffering from HIV/AIDS, to India after studying the market. ,""We will bring all innovative products for HIV/AIDS people, but we have just started, and need time to introduce them,"" said Gerhard Joubert, CEO, New Channel, Shriram Life. ,Star Health and Allied Insurance, a joint venture between Oman Insurance Company, ETA Ascon Group and a host of insurance veterans from India has already started offering the product.,According to 2006 estimates, the adult HIV prevalence in India is approximately 0.36 per cent that translates to between 2 and 3.1 million people. The concern is that the prevalence is high in the 15-49 age group (88.7 per cent of all infections), indicating that AIDS still threatens those in the prime of their working life.

Ludhiana has now got a dubious distinction of being among the cities most severely affected by AIDS, with the city having been placed under ""A"" category of HIV positive. This was revealed by National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) recently during a seminar organised by Delhi State AIDS Control Society. ,Disclosing this, Jagjit Singh Maan, founder president of Punjab Networking of Positive People Society (a non-government organization) said, ""NACO has also stated this in its guidelines issued to Integrated Counselling Testing Centres. Earlier, it was only Amritsar from Punjab which was under A category, but now Ludhiana also figures in the list due to increased number of HIV positive people."" ,Talking to The Indian Express, Maan said, ""Lack of awareness among people and the government's indifference to the affected people has brought the city under ""A' category. Our NGO has been serving in Punjab for the last four years, but still many HIV positive people are not aware of this and are still running after quacks. A few weeks ago, I met a family at Issaru village of Ludhiana district where two people had died due to AIDS. Their third member is also HIV positive. I requested them to go for anti retro viral therapy but they did not agree and opted for a wrong therapy."" ,The government's apathy to the problem nIt needs to be mentioned here that two years ago, the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, in cooperation with Department of Health and National AIDS Control Organization, had appointed 16 out-reach workers in Ludhiana and Amritsar districts. All these 16 were HIV positive people and were appointed in local hospitals and their work was to keep track of the HIV positive people — by visiting them at hospitals or at their homes. But now these 16 out-reach workers have been issued the notices telling them that their services were being terminated from November 30, 2009. ,Mehar Singh, one of the out-reach workers, said, ""We people were getting Rs 3,000 per month and were trying to pull along somehow. But now they have terminated our services. Where will we go?."" ,Meanwhile the Punjab Networking of Positive People Society on Sunday held a small function at Circuit House where it honoured all the HIV positive people who had helped in spreading awareness during the four-day stay of Red Ribbon Express in the city last year. ,Puja from Phagwara, who is also HIV positive, said, ""I want that government should give us something like sewing machines etc so that at least we can do something needful and earn our livelihood."" ,Jagjit Singh Maan said that if anyone wanted to help HIV positive people by offering them a job etc, he or she could contact him at his cell number 9463140554.

HIV-TB co-infection is on the increase in the city. And according to the Pune Municipal Corporation's Tuberculosis control unit, in the last one year 232 people of 1,229 who had TB infection, were detected with HIV. ,HIV infection has become a challenge for the control of TB and the government had decided to integrate services to TB and HIV patients by introducing a cross- referral system last year. Patients diagnosed with TB are offered testing for HIV; those testing positive undergo prophylactic treatment recommended by the World Health Organisation to ward off opportunistic infections like pneumonia. ,However, there is still a reluctance among TB patients to be referred to counselling centres for HIV testing. From October 2008 till September this year, of 3,767 newly detected TB patients only 1,229 patients decided to undergo counselling and HIV testing. Of these, 232 were found to be HIV positive, said Dr Dilip Jagtap, Chief of PMC TB control unit.,Prevention of HIV is the priority for TB control programmes. Every year at least around 5,000 new TB patients add to the list in the city. Parents with children with TB infection are particularly reluctant to undergo HIV counselling and testing. Another risk group is married women who also shy away from HIV testing, said Jagtap.,However, the number of TB patients being referred to counselling centres has increased in the last couple of months. For instance, a total of 221 out of 964 TB patients were referred to the HIV counselling centres from October-December 2008. The number has doubled in the last three months from July to September where 418 out of 892 TB patients were referred for HIV testing. ,There have been 152 HIV-TB deaths in 2007-08, Jagtap said. ""We have trained doctors and counsellors to ensure that people living with HIV who are visiting the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs) also report to the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP),"" he said.,In last quarter from July to September this year, out of 145 HIV positive patients who visited eight ICTCs in the city, 18 were detected with TB infection. According to National AIDS Control Organisation, nearly 80,000 people suffer from HIV-TB co-infection in the country.

,
,,A survey by the National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) in collaboration with Indian Council of Medical Research institutes in various states has shown a trend of HIV prevalence among sex workers who are not connected to brothels, thereby making it a challenge to provide interventions to them. ,NARI director Dr R S Paranjape said while the prevalence of HIV among brothel-based sex workers was 28 per cent in Mumbai and 37 per cent in Pune, the HIV prevalence among sex-workers not living in brothels was around 19 per cent in Mumbai and 37-38 per cent in Pune. ,The sample size that was surveyed in the high prevalence districts of Maharashtra,including Pune, Mumbai, Yavatmal, Kolhapur and Thane,was around 400 commercial sex workers. While indications of a downward trend of HIV prevalence are there in the sentinel surveillance programmes undertaken every year, researchers feel that interventions have still not reached all pockets. ,Paranjape said this is because there has been a change in the pattern of commercial sex work. So far it was brothel-based and limited to a certain area but now with presence of street-based sex workers and other groups, it is a challenge to provide interventional programmes. The survey has been funded by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation via Avahan and Family Health International (FHI) and is being conducted in six high prevalence states of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Mizoram and Manipur. The Gates foundation has given $2.5 million for the Integrated Behavioural and Biological Assessment Survey. ,The first round of survey was conducted in 2007 and was completed last year. The second round has started this year and results of the data are being analysed, Paranjape said. ""We not only want to find out whether HIV awareness programmes have reached the high-risk population of commercial sex workers, truck drivers, men having sex with men and clients of the sex workers, but the survey mainly aims at understanding the impact of the interventions."" ,The surveys include mapping of the high-risk population and here's how we found that a fair share of sex workers are no longer based in brothels, said Paranjape. A new group that has been included in the survey is the clients of sex workers. It is very difficult to obtain data from this group and the first round of survey shows that there is 6-11 per cent prevalence of HIV among clients of sex workers. ,For the second round of survey, 184 questions dealing with condom use, typology of sex, programme coverage and others have been prepared and is under way in 28 districts of the six states.

,

,

,
,


,
The Union Health and Family Welfare Ministry, through the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), will soon roll out free drugs for second-line antiretroviral treatment (ART) of HIV positive children in 10 states. ,Ahead of World AIDS Day on December 1, the news comes as a relief to over 1,400 children in the country who have failed to respond to first-line drugs available free at ART centres across the country. In January 2008, the government already introduced second-line treatment for adults not responding to first-line drugs. ,According to NACO guidelines, only patients who show treatment failure will be put on the second line of drugs. Centres in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, West Bengal, Chandigarh and Delhi will provide drugs for second-line ART. In Mumbai, Byculla-based state-run JJ Hospital (a centre of excellence for HIV treatment in Maharashtra) and the Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital in Sion (one of the regional centres for treatment of HIV positive children) will offer second-line drugs. ,Trends, according to experts, indicate that the rate of treatment failure at the end of three years of ART is one per cent among children. ""About one percent of pediatric cases put on first line of ART fails to respond and needs to be shifted to second-line therapy. In Sion Hospital, about 500 children are on ART, of which five to six require second-line therapy,"" said Dr Mamta Manglani, pediatric HIV specialist at Sion. ,""At JJ, of the 380 children on first line treatment, few cases will require the second line of treatment. This will be a new hope for infected children,"" said Dr Alaka Deshpande, who is in charge of the ART centre at JJ Hospital. ,To verify first-line drug failure, the parameters given by NACO include a viral load test, which is conducted at Kasturba Hospital laboratory. ""The second line of treatment for children should roll out in another two weeks after training of medical officers. NACO has already provided the drugs,"" said Dr Deshpande. JJ Hospital's ART centre will cater to children from public hospitals from Maharashtra, Goa and parts of Madhya Pradesh.  ,The BMC will screen short films for high-risk HIV groups like sex workers, transsexuals and homosexual men as a part of its month-long AIDS awareness drive. The films in Marathi and Hindi are aimed at creating awareness among groups most vulnerable to HIV. NACO has decided to translate these films into other Indian languages to be screened in other states. The Mumbai District Aids Control Society, along with other NGOs, will help the BMC in the awareness drive through street plays, stalls, exhibitions and contests in slum areas of Dharavi, Kamathipura etc.

,

,

,
,


,
Aids treatment in India has received a setback with the World Health Organisation (WHO) issuing a recommendation last week to phase out Stavudine, an antiretroviral drug used to treat HIV. Forty-five per cent patients in the country use Stavudine or d4T due to its low cost and widespread availability, and the WHO notification has put the government in  dilemma. ,According to the WHO, d4T should be phased out due to its ""long-term"" irreversible side-effects. Its December 1 guidelines, coinciding with World AIDS Day, instead recommend the use of Zidovudine (AZT) or Tenofovir (TDF) as these are ""less toxic"" and ""equally effective alternatives"".,The Department of AIDS Control is planning to call a meeting of experts to decide on the issue. ""The technical resource group on antiretroviral treatment will meet shortly and examine the pros and cons before some decision is taken,"" Dr Damodar Bachani, Deputy Director General, Department of AIDS Control, said. ,According to WHO, Stavudine is widely used in developing countries as a first-line therapy for HIV because it is easy to use and inexpensive. However, it causes serious side effects (see box). The drug is marketed as Zerit by Bristol-Myers Squibb, but is also available in generic versions through companies in India — Cipla, Aurobindo Pharma and Strides Arcolab. ,Scientists at National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) are surprised at the new guidelines, noting that Tenofovir costs twice as much as Stavudine, while an AZT regimen is also costlier. The regimen that uses Stavudine, Lamivudine and Nevirapine is also preferred as the AZT regimen causes anaemia. ""In a country where anaemia is already a problem, this cannot be administered,"" Dr Bachani says. Tenofovir is normally used as an alternative first-line drug for patients who have developed resistance to Stavudine and AZT. ,Saying that there is no immediate threat to those using Stavudine, Dr Bachani told The Indian Express that 2.8 lakh people in the country are on antiretroviral treatment. ,Dr Yusuf Hamied, Chairman and Managing Director of Cipla pharmaceuticals who fought multinational companies to provide generic AIDS drugs at a low cost in India and Africa, is outraged at the new guideline, and hints at big companies trying to kill a drug because of the expiry of patent. ""Let the doctors decide instead of multinational companies,"" he fumes.,Cipla produces a triple-drug cocktail that includes Stavudine and sells between US $60 and $90 per patient per year in Africa. This same cocktail, which was under a monopoly, was being sold at US $12,000 per patient per year in 2001. Cipla eventually brought it down to US $100 in Africa. Hamied points out that today four million patients are on generic drugs in Africa due to the low cost. ,""Cipla is selling a family of AIDS drugs,"" Hamied says. ""We manufacture according to requirements. When the product patent of a drug expires, companies try to kill it in a bid to retain monopoly over their drugs. Let the doctors decide whether the drug has to be phased out or not, he says.,Cipla CEO Amar Lulla, said that if there was medical evidence showing that Stavudine had adverse effects, he would support its phasing out. However, he added: ""There will have to be more budget allocations if the government plans to shift (to another drug).""

,
To mitigate the harassment faced by HIV/AIDS patients, the West Bengal State Aids Prevention Control Society (WBSACS) has decided to set up Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) centres at the block primary healthcare centres. ,The decision has been taken in view of problems faced by HIV positive patients in remote areas who have to travel miles to reach a nodal ART centre located in the state-run hospital for medicinal needs. ,Currently, there are five nodal ART centres in the state — School of Tropical Medicine, North Bengal Medical College and Hospital, Burdwan Medical College, Malda District Hospital and RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. Two other new nodal centres at M R Bangur Hospital and Islampur sub-divisional hospital are expected to come up by the end of this year. ,According to WBSACS, by the end of this month, two ART centres are supposed to come up at Raghunathpur in Purulia and Murshidabad. ,The new ART centres would now allow the HIV patients residing close to these areas to collect their dose of HIV medicines without much hassle.  ,The project is being funded by the National Aids Prevention Control Society (NACO). ,The WBSACS also aims to set up Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres at all the block primary healthcare centres in the state. ,Initially, the training centres would be set up in 114 blocks in districts like North Dinajpur, Darjeeling, Burdwan and Bankura, where AIDS cases have been increasing. ,In areas like Kharibari, Jhum Jhumi BPHC of Darjeeling, Shindipal BPHC of Birbhum and Hilly, Kumarganj BPHC of Dakshin Dinajpur, such testing centres are expected to become operational by next year.  ,The centres would have a counsellor, a laboratory technician and a consultant doctor.

,
,


,
To diagnose HIV at an early stage and thereby bring down the number of deaths among HIV infected kids below 18 months of age, National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) will introduce the Early Infant Diagnosis Programme from January next year.,NACO will do blood tests of infants, using the DNA-PCR method, as early as six weeks so that interventions could be started at an early stage. The method is currently being used in research labs to detect viruses and bacteria. ,""This is a new technology. In India it is not used for diagnosing HIV. In this, the blood samples will help identify the virus,"" NACO deputy director general Dr Damodar Bachani said. ,Health officials said until now it was difficult to diagnose and put children on medication at an early stage as till 18 months of age, the maternal antibodies remain present in the children. It is only after antibodies vanish, the children can be diagnosed and treated. And, since they could not be treated till 18 months of age, many of them die without any treatment. ,""We will now be able to know the status of the child as early as 6 weeks of age and can start intervention there and then. This will help reducing the deaths amongst children,"" Dr Bachani said.,At present, mothers and the newborn are given nevirapine at the time of delivery to cut the risk of transmission of HIV from mother to infant. Around 30 per cent of infants contract HIV if mothers do not take the medicine, Bachani said. ,NACO has already imported kits for this purpose from Germany and technicians have been trained to use the kit. The new method would be used in 700 integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTC) across the country from January. ,NACO has also decided to raise eligibility limit for mothers to avail anti-retroviral treatment by raising level of CD 4 count to 350. Earlier, a mother with HIV and a CD 4 count of 250 could avail ART drugs.

Kerala has succeeded in checking the spread of AIDS due to intensive awareness campaigns and innovative counselling at testing centres, according to the state AIDS Control Society.,Joint Director of the Society, S Ajai Kumar attributed the success to programmes implemented through unique service centres and work undertaken at the grassroot level with person to person contact.,""Branding of service centres has increased uptake,"" he told, stating that Kerala is the only state to brand service centres in this way.,Kumar said the campaign's success could be judged from the increase in the number of those voluntarily going to testing centres from 11,000 in 2006 to 57,600 till October 2009.,With an estimated 55,000 HIV positive people, Kerala's average is less than the national figure, at about 0.26 per cent against 0.34 per cent, he said. ,Kumar however cautioned against any complacency, saying that though the disease was under check, there was every possibility it could turn worse.,Elaborating on how branding of the centres had brought about success, he said 'Jyothi' centres at various places in Kerala all have facilities for free counselling and HIV testing.,While some branded centres create district level platforms for the affected, others treat Sexually Transmitted Diseases and reproductive tract infections free of cost, he said.,He said the society had found that HIV density was high among drug addicts at 7.96 per cent, compared to other high risk groups like truck drivers at 3.60 per cent and 1.2 per cent in homosexuals. Among women sex workers, the density was 0.40 per cent, he said.,Kumar said 88.7 per cent of the 2.31 million HIV infected people in India are in the 15 to 49 age group. In Kerala too, the disease is more prevalent among this age group, he said.

However, these patients often undergo depression and need emotional support. While counsellors do play a role, there is often a need to share their lives with a partner and hence the meeting will provide a platform for them to interact with each other,"" says Sanjay Jadhav from the Network of People Living with HIV in Pune. ,They have sexual needs and despite their ailment, couples can either adopt a child or even take preventive measures to ensure that their biological child does not have HIV.

UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has expressed concerns that institutionalized discrimination against groups most at risk was blocking their access to prevention and treatment of AIDS which remains one of the leading causes of premature deaths in the world.,The UNSG called for shining the ""full light of human rights on HIV"" to achieve the goal of universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support by 2010, which meant countering any form of HIV-related stigma and discrimination.,""In many countries, legal frameworks institutionalize discrimination against groups most at risk. Yet discrimination against sex workers, drug users and men who have sex with men only fuels the epidemic and prevents cost-effective interventions,"" Ban said.,We must ensure that AIDS responses are based on evidence, not ideology, and reach those most in need and most affected, he added.,The UN Chief underlined the importance to protecting vulnerable groups by ""eliminating violence against women and girls and ensuring access to HIV information and services"".,""I urge all countries to remove punitive laws, policies and practices that hamper the AIDS response, including travel restrictions against people living with HIV. Successful AIDS responses do not punish people; they protect them,"" he said.,Ban acknowledged that investments in the AIDS response was saving lives leading to reversing the AIDS epidemics in some countries but in global terms new infections were outpacing the gains achieved in putting people on treatment.,The head of the UN body on AIDS - UNAIDS, Michel Sidibé, also noted that the present economic crisis should not be a reason for reducing investments in health.,Ban, last evening, joined actress and UNAIDS goodwill ambassador Naomi Watts as well as New York City Council speaker, Christine Quinn, in the ""Light for Rights"" World AIDS Day event in Washington Square Park in New York.,Lights in the park and on top of the Empire State building will be dimmed simultaneously to symbolise how human rights infringements cast a dark shadow on the response to AIDS.,In his remarks at the park, Ban once again reiterated that discrimination against people living with HIV, sex workers, drug users, and men who have sex with men only fuels the epidemic.

On the occasion of World AIDS Day today, the Pune City AIDS Control Society plans will take out an awareness rally in the city. The rally will start from Sassoon Hospital and end at Shaniwar Wada.  The rally's theme will be  'Be HIV-positive'. Organisations like Network of People Living with HIV in Maharashtra have planned to encourage people to disclose their HIV-positive status while organisations like Sampathik trust will set up stalls in Pimpri-Chinchwad to distribute condoms among the high-risk  MSM (Men having sex with men) group.  ,The National AIDS Research Institute has also kept an 'open day' so that people can visit their laboratories and understand what HIV is all about. On December 1, at 4 pm, several activists will participate in a march with the central message of 'being HIV positive'. ,""While the prevalence rate of HIV has stabilised, the stigma associated with the disease remains rampant and destructive,"" says Roshni Mehta, coordinator of the Wake up Pune campaign. Activists claim that it is this societal pressure against speaking about HIV prevention and the discrimination against those infected, which fuels the spread of the virus. ,""Reports of HIV-positive people being forced out from their homes and villages  are not uncommon,"" says Abbas Parvane, project Manager of Sahara Aalhad (a care home and rehabilitation centre for people living with HIV). ,Meanwhile the Network of People Living with HIV in Maharashtra (NMP+) has also raised the issue of the slow scale-up for provisions of 2nd line of drugs for treatment of HIV which is increasingly beoming a concern for HIV positive people. According to Manoj Pardeshi of the NMP+, until March this year, only 344 patients had received the drugs. ,According to a 2007 study conducted by the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS,) 18,039 people were tested for HIV in Pune between January and October. 12.27 per cent of those tested positive. This will be followed by a stage show which will include motivational speakers, dance, and music. ,Organisations like Aarogya.com's AIDS support group will also observe the World AIDS Day with the them 'Universal access and human rights'.,At Aarogya.com's e-support groups, efforts are made to bring people suffering from HIV and other illnesses together. They have decided to function as a matrimonial site for those with HIV, and will launch 'Vivah' on December 1.

Amritsar has reported maximum number of HIV positive patients and deaths at anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centres in the state. ,According to the data gleaned from the Punjab State AIDS Control Society (PSACS), with 6,262 HIV positive patients till October this year, the holy city tops the chart, followed by Patiala at 2,333 and Jalandhar at 2,088. Barnala has reported least number of cases in the state, 85. ,At present, 681 persons from Amritsar are on ART, which is maximum in the state. It is closely followed by the neighbouring border districts of Tarn Taran that has 661 cases and Gurdaspur that has 539. In this category too, Barnala has the least number of patients — 14. ,Amritsar also leads in the cumulative number of deaths. One hundred and four persons died at ART centres in Amritsar, followed by 99 in Jalandhar and 94 in Hoshiarpur. No death was reported in Mohali.,The number of people living with HIV globally is 33.4 million; nearly half of them are women. Close to 2.7 million people were infected in 2008 alone, of which more than half were aged between 15 and 24 years. More than two million people died of AIDS-related illness in 2008, including 2.8 lakh children under the age of 15. ,In India, about 2.47 million people are infected. As per the PSACS , the infection prevalence in Punjab is 0.11 per cent as against the national figure of 0.36 per cent. The state has so far reported 17,820 HIV positive cases; AIDS cases on ART are 7,567 and reported deaths are 786. ,Due to easy availability of drugs and high purchasing power in the state, injection drug users (IDUs) are emerging as the major problem. The latest mapping study and surveillance data has indicated at increasing HIV positive cases in IDUs category. PSACS is focusing on IUDs through 15 targeted intervention (TI) projects. ,Meanwhile, Punjab Health Department will organise the state-level World AIDS Day function at Qadian in Gurdaspur district on Tuesday, where Health Minister Laxmi Kanta Chawla will be the chief guest. ,Satish Chandra, Principal Secretary, and Dr SPS Sohal, Director, Health Services, Punjab will be also be present at the programme, which would be based on the theme of UNAIDS, 'Universal Access and Human Rights, Stop AIDS, Keep the Promise'.,Fortis Charitable Foundation's month-long activities for creating awareness on AIDS culminated on Monday with a candle-light march in which over 1,000 students from various school and colleges of the city, their parents and doctors, participated. The march was led by the Health Minister Laxmi Kanta Chawla, Mayor Shwet Malik and SSP P K Rai. Earlier in a function, Chawla stressed the need for such programmes which would go in long way for spreading awareness about HIV/AIDS and the social stigmas surrounding this disease.

Fifty-year-old Sumita (name changed) has spent twenty years of her life as a sex worker in the red-light district of Sonagachi near Kolkata. Like thousands in Sonagachi, she struggles every day to keep the deadly virus of AIDS at bay.,While Sumita comes to the narrow alleys that house hundreds of multi-stories brothels every evening looking for her clients, many others have made Sonagachi their home. ,""I was forced to take up this profession after my husband got paralysed and his pension money went to his second wife. I shifted to Behala with my son and want my son to study,"" she said. ""He is studying in Class XII and does not know that I work here. For years, we did not know about HIV/AIDS. But now I do and I force my customers to wear a condom. But sometimes it gets difficult when clients try to act smart,"" Sumita added. ,Nearly 5.17 per cent of 13,000 sex workers in Sonagachi are HIV positive and living in dark about their future. Experts claim that despite the initial success of the Buladi campaign launched by the state government, the effort has slowly fizzled out and failed to make any impact in Bengal's rural areas.,""In 1992, 2.7 per cent sex workers were HIV positive, today it is almost 6 per cent. However, it is still lower than in other Indian red-light districts,"" said Bharati Deb, project director of Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee (DMSC) — a platform for sex workers working on projects and running sex workers' cooperative to empower them.,According to the committee, nearly 11 per cent sex workers in Sonagachi are out of the purview of safe sex till date. ""Sometimes sex workers, who are old, are refused by clients to use protection and since they get less customers they succumb to it. Even women who drink a lot refuse to understand the issue of HIV,"" said Deb.,According to a recent study conducted by West Bengal State Aids Prevention Control Society (WBSACS) 24,000 adults and 400 children are suffering from HIV in the state. The high risk districts are Uttar Dinajpur, Purulia, Burdwan, Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, Musrhidabad and East Midnapore. ,Recently, the WBSACS formed a state-level interdepartmental co-ordination committee to help HIV-affected mothers and their children. The departments, which are part of this committee, include school education, social welfare and rural and panchayat department. The HIV infected mothers and their children will be kept in a home and the state government will provide financial help. ,""More awareness campaigns should be launched by the state government on the deadly disease,"" Deb added.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court has ruled that paramilitary forces cannot deny promotion to personnel infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). ,The court has directed the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) to promote a personnel to the rank of Naik with effect from December 12, 1996. ,The petitioner, would also be entitled to seniority and all consequential benefits illegally denied, and be considered for further promotion if any. ,The official will be allowed to avail of all consequential benefits, including seniority, emoluments and promotional posts, the order reads. ,The petitioner had contended that he was denied promotion on the grounds that he had tested HIV positive. He was initially recruited as a constable (general duty) in 1987 and was allocated the 2nd Battalion in Dehradun. He was then promoted as Lance Naik in 1992 and his next promotion was supposed to be that of Naik. ,He submitted that he was empanelled for promotion, vide the order of the Director General and that all those empanelled, except him, were granted promotion on December 12, 1995. But his name did not figure in the list. The petitioner also stated that even his junior was among those promoted. ,Prior to the empanelment, the petitioner was examined by one Dr M K Rao in July 1994 and the doctor had declared the petitioner unfit for further service in ITBP on the ground that he was found HIV positive. It was on the basis of the report of the doctor, the petitioner submitted, that he was not considered for promotion. ,The court also referred to the Union government's instructions that clearly provides for continuance of HIV positive personnel in service in the paramilitary force, except those falling in the unfit category. ,The court also pointed out that it was clear from the reply of the then Minister of State for Defence in the Rajya Sabha, that HIV positive status by itself was not sufficient to deny service or even promotion to a member of the paramilitary service. ,On the contrary, the court pointed out, the service and promotions are protected in such cases where the ailment is symptomatic. ,The petitioner, who tested HIV positive in 1995, is still in service.

,

,

,
,


,
With half of the 2.5 million Indians infected with HIV being women, researchers are developing women controlled methods that include vaginal microbicides and female condoms to prevent HIV. ,At National AIDS Research Institute, a phase II safety and acceptability trial of a non medicated vaginal ring among 150 healthy uninfected women will get underway. ,Dr Mallika Alexander, medical manager of the Clinical Trial Unit at NARI, said that earlier a rubber ring was inserted inside the vagina for women who had prolapse of the uterus. ,Now, with even being flexible vaginal rings being used as contraceptives abroad, NARI too has decided to place non medicated vaginal rings in women to study if they can be used safely and continuously, she added. ,In Pune, the prevalence of HIV among women is less than one per cent. While behaviour modifications (abstinence and monogamous relationship) and condom use are the only preventive measures, there clearly is an urgent need to develop women controlled methods that can be used without depending on the husband for protection from HIV, said Alexander. ,Some of the methods that are being researched towards this end include vaginal microbicides and female condoms.  ,Female condom is a strong, flexible, lubricated polyurethane sheath, about 17 centimetres (6.7 inches) long, with a flexible ring at each end. The closed end is inserted into the woman's body, and the open end remains outside during intercourse. Like the male condom, it offers dual protection against unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. ,Subsidized female condoms have been provided by the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) to high-risk women in the four states of Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, and West Bengal. ,Vaginal microbicide is a medicinal or herbal product used intravaginally to prevent STDs including HIV.  Microbicides prevent vaginal transmission of HIV through various mechanisms. These include inactivation of the virus in the vagina itself, prevention of the virus from entering into the host's cell, by decreasing the vaginal pH which inactivates the virus and forming an invisible lining for the vagina that acts as a barrier between the virus and the vagina. ,Some of the Anti Retro Viral drugs are also being developed as microbicides. Currently, safe and effective microbicides to block HIV are not yet available, but globally, 11 microbicides and 6 Anti Retro Viral (ARV) based HIV prevention products are in 38 clinical trials, of which two candidates are in Phase III trials. ,NARI has successfully conducted five phase 1 trials of  PRO gel, buffer gel, praneem and nonoxynol 9 — all microbicide candidates and two phase II trials of praneem and tenofovir gel.,This fresh study will be launched to provide answers to how long a vaginal ring can be used continuously and safely, said Alexander.

The first Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) for women prisoners in the country, recently started  in Byculla Jail, has hit a wall ahead of World AIDS Day. ,Female technicians of the Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS) are refusing to go into the jail to take blood samples of female inmates citing their ""rowdiness"". The centre, opened just last month,has not collected the blood sample of a single female inmate. ,""We had a technician earlier but after a visit to the jail, she refused to work. They are afraid of the prisoners and their rowdiness,"" said project director (MDACS) Dr S S Kudalkar. MDACS has now advertised for fresh female technicians. Kudalkar said interviews will be taken and appointments made soon.,Stories of female inmates being more aggressive that their male counterparts are rampant, an official said. ""The technicians fear that the inmates will harm them while drawing their blood for tests,"" said the official in-charge of the ICTC at the prison. ,Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai, Tihar Jail in Delhi, Puzhal Jail in Chennai and Amritsar Central Prison have HIV intervention programmes for prisoners but the ICTC in Byculla Jail, set up in October, is the first for female jail inmates in the country.,""We faced a problem at Arthur Road Jail but managed to overcome the problem immediately,"" said the official. ,The ICTC has two members, a lab technician and a senior counsellor. So far, with the help of the counsellor, 53 female prisoners have been given pre-test counselling but blood tests have been stuck because of the technicians' unwillingness to take samples. The process involves a two-hour programme in which prisoners are counselled and blood samples drawn after they give their written consent. Following the results (positive or negative), post-test counselling is conducted. ,At Arthur Road Jail, blood samples of around 400 prisoners have been taken and 19 have tested positive. They are undergoing counselling and antiretroviral treatment. The ICTC were opened in Mumbai's prisons after the Bombay High Court, hearing a case on non-treatment of HIV-positive prisoners at Pune's Yerwada Jail, slammed the authorities and directed the government to plan and provide treatment to HIV-positive prisoners.   ,Apart from counselling and training, ICTC provides AIDS awareness educational material to prison staff. Treatment and information on HIV/ AIDS and the risk of drug abuse, homosexual contacts are given to prisoners.

The Transport Corporation of India Foundation (TCIF), the social arm of the Transport Corporation of India, organised the fifth nationwide 'Truckers' Utsav' ahead of World Aids Day at 15 locations across the country on Sunday. ,The event was aimed at creating awareness among truckers on the prevention of HIV/AIDS through concerts, street plays, song and dance performances and quizzes. ,""The event is an annual feature that provides a platform to bring thousands of truck drivers together to create awareness on the prevention of HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases in an interesting and entertaining manner. Owing to the nature of their job, truck drivers have to travel long distances and stay away from their families for long durations, and are found to be the group most vulnerable to sexually transmitted diseases,"" Shekhar Setu, project director for TCIF, said. ""The initiative is targeted at taking care of both their physical and mental health."",The Utsav had various multi-speciality health camps and parallel competitive events like arm-wrestling, bucket-lifting and singing contests, apart from the best maintained truck contest. ,India has around five million truck drivers, with around 2 million of them travelling on long haul routes. Being sexually active, the community is found to be a very high-risk group, and also suffers from low self-esteem and social stigma.,The overall prevalence of HIV/AIDS among long-distance truckers is reported to be 4.6 percent, as compared to 0.36 percent among the general population, the organisers said.   ,The initiative, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, aims to implement a comprehensive integrated package on treatment for sexually transmitted infections, behaviour change communications, condom promotion and counselling among truck drivers through strategically located interventions at major halt points in nine states along national highways across the country. ,""The programme has made us conscious of the disease and preventive care that needs to be taken. There are practical problems and challenges in our job — this initiative realistically addresses those issues,"" said Om Prakash, a truck driver who attended the event at Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar. ,Organisers of the event told Newsline that considering the increased use of condoms and detection of cases, it can be hoped that not only have awareness levels gone up, but the spread of the disease is also being checked.

A 22-YEAR immigration ban which prevented those affected with HIV/AIDS from entering the US was lifted on Monday, the BBC reported. In October, President Barack Obama said an entry ban had been ""rooted in fear rather than fact"". The decision to lift the ban came in the wake of Obama's declaration that the ban was not in keeping with US plans to be a leader in the fight against the disease. ,The ban was imposed at the height of a panic about the disease at the end of the 1980s, BBC said. Rachel Tiven, the head of the campaign group Immigration Equality, told BBC that the step was long overdue. The ban placed the US among 12 countries that imposed restrictions on people suffering from HIV/AIDS. Other countries that follow the ban include Saudi Arabia and Libya, the BBC website said.,To address issues related to the disease, the US had planned to host a global HIV/Aids summit for the first time in 2012. However, the ban would have reduced its impact. ""2012 World Aids Conference, due to be held in the US, was in jeopardy as a result of the restrictions. It's now likely to go ahead as planned,"" BBC quoted Tiven as saying.

In an endeavour to formulate India-specific treatment guidelines for HIV patients, a group of medical professionals here has set up an organisation which will offer an in-depth clinical training to its members from this year.,Named 'HIV Medicine Association of India' (HIV-MAI), the new body will impart clinical training to doctors in order to enable them to offer effective treatment suited to Indian conditions rather than relying on western guidelines which have been found inadequate to address the HIV cases in India, according to Dr Sanjay Pujari, director, HIV-MAI.,""The new organisation has already tied up with international training partners which include 'HIV Treatment Resourced Initiative (HIVTRI)', a UK based NGO to impart clinical training with international experts as instructors,"" he said.,Underlining the need to launch the new initiative, Dr Pujari, who has been offering support to HIV/AIDS patients in Maharashtra for many years, said, ""'American Foundation for AIDS Research' (AMFAR) and 'Treat Asia' organisations have, in a report released recently, recognised this training gap and shortage of HIV specialists. Our own needs assessment showed that over 90 per cent doctors treating HIV/AIDS patients agree that more training and India specific guidelines are necessary."",Explaining the risks that entail faulty line of treating HIV patients in India, Pujari said, ""AMFAR report is very clear that using HIV drugs incorrectly could actually make the epidemic worse in India."",The report, as quoted, says ""the combination of increasingly available drugs to treat HIV disease and the lack of trained doctors to administer them could lead to widespread misuse and eventually to drug resistance, eradicating years of progress in treatment and prevention of HIV/AIDS across the region."",""Our mission statement emphasises that all people in India with HIV/AIDS deserve uniform, quality care,"" Dr Pujari said adding ""while there are many HIV and AIDS NGOs in India, none of them are specifically for doctors and none of them focus on developing India-specific, evidence-based treatment guidelines for patient management."",Dr N Kumarasamy, one of the HIV specialists associated with the venture said, ""we need to engaged in India-specific clinical research and clinical trials so that our treatment standards continue to improve and reflect India's unique conditions pertaining to the pandemic's attributes here."",People with HIV in India can be suffering from a variety of other conditions not seen as often in more developed nations, for example, very high rates of TB and Hepatitis, Kumarasamy said.,""Resource constraints is another problem in India with most affected families being unable to afford the prohibitive cost of effective drugs and diagnostics as well as good nourishment to the HIV patient,"" he noted.,The new challenges in the treatment include ""drug resistance, ARV toxicities and complex drug-drug interactions,"" Pujari said.,""HIV/MAI hopes to outline and implement programs and guidelines to optimise long term outcomes associated with treatment of HIV,"" he added.

The anti-oxidant properties of kinnows not only reduce chances of cancer, but can also lower the risk of contracting HIV, says Dr B S Ghuman, Director, Punjab Horticultural Postharvest Technology Centre (PHPTC). ,""Kinnows are a good source of Vitamin A and C. They contain anti-mocrobial properties and are rich in minerals, vitamins and have saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium in less quantity. These properties are know to prevent HIV and cancer,"" said Ghuman, talking to The Indian Express.,In a letter written to Deputy Director (Horticulture)-cum-Nodal Officer (Citrus) Dr Gurkanwal Singh, he has written that various studies being conducted in the USA on citrus fruits have also shown that they contain anti-cancerous properties.Even the kinnow-peel has medicinal properties, he added. ""Having kinnows in any form, including juice, is good for health. It contains Limonin, an anti-cancerous compound, and Caroten, a good source of Vitamin A,"" said Dr Ghuman.,Dr Gurkanwal said after these findings were made, the demand of kinnows has increased in the country as well as the global market.,According to the initial research on these properties, the seeds contained in the kinnows are also good for health. Earlier, kinnows from Punjab were not considered good because of high quantity of seeds, but now the same thing is its quality, he added. ,The horticulture department is making efforts to increase the area under kinnows and every year around 2,000 hectares are being added for growing kinnows. ""The department has already set up five kinnow estates in blocks of Hoshiarpur and Ferozepur districts, where thousands of hectares have been dedicated to growing the fruit,"" Ghuman said.,To help farmers who cannot afford equipment required for growing kinnows, farming societies have been formed. Farmers can get the equipments on hire. However, they are charged only for maintenance of the equipment and the societies do not reap any profit. The horticulture department also provides funds and technical know-how to these societies, said Dr Gurkanwal Singh, Deputy Director (Horticulture)-cum-Nodal Officer (Citrus).

It  has been ""highly successful"" in preventing transmission of HIV to infants via breastfeeding by almost half at six weeks when compared with a single dose of NVP given to infants at birth which is the current standard of care. ,""Moreover, at six months, risk of post-natal HIV infection or death in babies who received NVP for six weeks was less than one-third the risk for infants given only a single dose,"" said Nishi Suryavanshi, investigator with the clinical trial conducted at B J Medical College. ,The combined rates of HIV infection and death at both six weeks and six months were significantly lower in the SWEN group than in the group that received the standard, single-dose NVP regimen alone. The risk of postnatal HIV infection or death at six weeks was 42 percent lower in the SWEN group than in the single-dose group, and at six months, the risk was 27 percent lower than in the single-dose group. These findings contributed to the change of WHO guidelines. ,""Approximately 150,000 infants worldwide annually acquire HIV through breastfeeding and hence the findings are important¿,"" said researchers Dr Robert Bollinger, Dr J Sastry and others.

In a breakthrough in research for HIV treatment, scientists on Sunday claimed to have deciphered the three-dimensional structure of an enzyme responsible for propagating the virus in a body.,The design of enzyme 'integrase' — used by HIV to transfer its genetic information into the infected person's DNA and to pass on the infection — was a puzzle for researchers for last two decades. Researchers at Imperial College here and Harvard University have grown a crystal which deciphered the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme, according to findings published in the latest edition of journal Nature.,""New antiretroviral drugs for HIV work by blocking integrase, but scientists did not understand exactly how these drugs were working or how to improve them,"" a statement from Imperial College said. High quality crystals are the only way to know the detailed three-dimensional structure of such enzymes.,""Over the course of four years, the researchers carried out over 40,000 trials, out of which they were able to grow just seven kinds of crystals. Only one of these was of sufficient quality to allow determination of the three-dimensional structure,"" it said. ,Findings revealed that the enzyme has quite a different structure to that which had been predicted earlier. ,In order to develop the crystal, researchers grew a crystal using borrowed integrase from little known retrovirus Prototype Foamy Virus (PFV) as they believed that it was very similar to its HIV counterpart. ""We went back to square one and started by looking for a better model of HIV integrase, which could be more amenable for crystallisation,"" Peter Cherepanov, the lead author of the study said. ,The researchers also soaked these crystals in antiretroviral drugs such as Raltegravir and Elvitegravir to understand how they bind to and cause inactivation of integrase. ,""Availability of the integrase structure means that researchers can begin to fully understand how existing drugs that inhibit integrase are working, how they might be improved, and how to stop HIV developing resistance to them,"" the statement said.

Scientists say they have solved a crucial puzzle about the AIDS virus after 20 years of research and that their findings could lead to better treatments for HIV.,British and U.S. researchers said they had grown a crystal that enabled them to see the structure of an enzyme called integrase, which is found in retroviruses like HIV and is a target for some of the newest HIV medicines.,""Despite initially painstakingly slow progress and very many failed attempts, we did not give up and our effort was finally rewarded,"" said Peter Cherepanov of Imperial College London, who conducted the research with scientists from Harvard University.,The Imperial and Harvard scientists said that having the integrase structure means researchers can begin fully to understand how integrase inhibitor drugs work, how they might be improved, and how to stop HIV developing resistance to them.,When the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects someone, it uses the integrase enzyme to paste a copy of its genetic information into their DNA, Cherepanov explained in the study published in the Nature journal on Sunday.,Some new drugs for HIV -- like Isentress from Merck & Co and elvitegravir, an experimental drug from Gilead Sciences -- work by blocking integrase, but scientists are not clear exactly how they work or how to improve them.,The only way to find out was to obtain high-quality crystals -- a project that had defeated scientists for many years.,""When we started out, we knew that the project was very difficult, and that many tricks had already been tried and given up by others long ago,"" said Cherepanov.,""Therefore, we went back to square one and started by looking for a better model of HIV integrase which could be more amenable for crystallization."",The researchers grew a crystal using a version of integrase borrowed from another retrovirus very similar to its HIV counterpart.,It took more than 40,000 trials for them to come up with one a crystal of sufficiently high quality to allow them to see the three-dimensional structure, they said.,They tested the Merck and Gilead drugs on the crystals, and were able to see for the first time how the medicines bind to, and block, integrase.,Almost 60 million people have been infected with HIV and 25 million people have died of HIV-related causes since the beginning of the AIDS epidemic. There is no cure and no vaccine, although drug cocktails can keep patients healthy.,United Nations data for 2008 show that 33.4 million people had HIV and 2 million people died of AIDS. The worst-affected region is sub-Saharan Africa, accounting for 67 percent of all people living with HIV.

Disclosing results of a clinical trial, researchers at Dartmouth Medical School (DMS) have shown that a new vaccine against tuberculosis, Mycobacterium vaccae (MV), is effective in preventing tuberculosis in people with HIV infection. ,The DarDar Health Study, named for Dartmouth and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, found that MV immunization reduced the rate of definite tuberculosis by 39 per cent among 2,000 HIV-infected patients in Tanzania.,""Since development of a new vaccine against tuberculosis is a major international health priority, especially for patients with HIV infection, we and our Tanzanian collaborators are very encouraged by the results of the DarDar Study,"" said Principal Investigator Dr. Ford von Reyn.,The 7-year, randomised, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in Tanzania with collaborators at the Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences (MUHAS) in Dar es Salaam, and was supported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States. ,""The study confirms that University institutions from the northern and southern hemispheres can establish partnerships to perform quality clinical research work with global importance. The results of the study are not only good news for people living in regions with high infection rates of HIV and tuberculosis but has also contributed to capacity building in performing TB vaccine trials among HIV infected persons in Tanzania,"" said Dr. Kisali Pallangyo, the senior collaborator at MUHAS.,Since newly-infected HIV patients risk contracting TB almost immediately, Dartmouth investigators are targeting a strategy for immunization with MV before patients need to start taking antiretroviral drugs.,In Phase-I human studies, the researchers demonstrated that a multiple-dose series of MV was safe in both healthy subjects and patients with HIV infection.,The group then conducted Phase-II studies in larger groups of adults in Zambia and in Finland. ,In the Zambian trial, it was found that MV boosted immune responses against tuberculosis that had first been primed in childhood with the current TB vaccine, BCG.,Then they conducted the large Phase-III efficacy trial among HIV-infected patients with prior BCG immunization in Tanzania.,Von Reyn, a Professor in the Department of Medicine at DMS, described the DarDar trial as ""a significant milestone"" – the first to demonstrate that any type of vaccine can prevent an infectious complication of HIV in adults.,He added that the next steps are to improve the manufacturing methods to support the production of the larger quantities of the TB vaccine needed for further studies and subsequent clinical use. ,Development work on manufacturing will be conducted by the Aeras Global TB Vaccine Foundation in Rockville, Maryland, in conjunction with the London-based manufacturer, Immodulon Therapeutics.,""Aeras'' goal is to speed the development and distribution of new TB vaccines for those who need them most. We are pleased that our internal manufacturing capacity can assist in the further development of this TB vaccine,"" said Dr. Jerald C. Sadoff.,The vaccine is a type known as an inactivated, whole-cell mycobacterial vaccine and is expected to be economical to produce and distribute, said von Reyn.,The study appears in the latest online issue of the journal AIDS, and it will be published in the March print issue of AIDS.

,
With the number of HIV cases going down across the nation, the city too has registered fewer cases of the disease as compared to the last few years. ,In contrast to the 12 per cent positive cases registered in 2006, only five per cent cases were found positive in 2009. ,The absolute numbers too have shown a downward trend as 2008 figures suggest over 1,200 cases were found positive, while the first 10 months of 2009 had around 900 positive cases. ,According to figures of the State AIDS Control Society (SACS), Chandigarh, the number of HIV positive people has indeed gone down in the city, albeit marginally. ,Officials attribute this trend to better awareness drives and the targeted intervention programmes. The graph, however, is not any different from the way things are going nationally. ,""We feel the target intervention programme launched by the society two years ago has had its impact. ,The society has started 13 target intervention programmes in target groups,"" remarked officials. ,The declining trend is reflected both in the percentage of affected people and the death related to AIDS. ,According to official figures, while in 2007, 114 persons had fallen victim to the infection, the toll came down to 97 in 2008 and to 61 in the first eight months of 2009. ,As far as the percentage is concerned, of the 8,924 persons screened in 2006, 1,066 (12 per cent) were found HIV positive. In 2007, 13,630 persons were screened, of which 1,144 (eight per cent) were found HIV positive. ,In 2008, the percentage of HIV positive cases further came down to 7 per cent, with 1,239 people being found HIV positive of the 17,405 persons screened. ,The biggest decline, however, was registered in 2009, when up to August, of the 17,156 people screened, only 937 (five per cent) were found positive.

Although the Central government has extended the facility of subsidised ration to HIV positive, the social stigma attached to it is the main hurdle which keeps them away from availing of this benefit.  Jagjit Singh Maan, Chairman, Punjab Networking of Positive People Society, ""Our society has about 600 HIV positive people. About three months ago, the Central government issued a circular stating that all HIV positive people could get subsidised ration from the depots of the District Food and Civil Supply department under Antodaya scheme. Earlier, under the scheme, subsidised ration was given to the people below poverty line. As per the governments' instructions, each HIV positive person is supposed to get a certificate from the ART centre Centre stating the HIV positivity of a person. After submitting the certificate, they can get subsidised ration from the ration depot concerned."" ,Maan said, ""HIV positive people are not willing not avail this benefit as it would their eat into their privacy. These people say that when they will go to ration depots for getting ration, or to the DFSC office, residents will identify them and their privacy of their disease would be made public. The government should find some other way out to give them subsidised ration."" ,Meanwhile Dr Harjinder Singh, Senior Medical Officer, Civil Hospital, Ludhiana, said, ""I have not received any instructions for issuing certificate to HIV positive people.""

After receiving encouraging results from five districts where Uttar Pradesh State AIDS Control Society (UPSACS) had roped in grassroots level health workers for HIV/AIDS training and awareness programmes, the organisation is planning to approach self help groups (SHG) as well as village panchayats for bringing the HIV/AIDS training and awareness programmes into the mainstream.,""We have already trained more than 2,000 anganwadi and ASHA workers from five districts between June and December last year and the results were encouraging,"" said Ramesh Menon, Project Director, State Mainstreaming Unit, UPSACS. ,While Banda, Itawa, Devariya, and Mau were chosen for being Category A districts — the vulnerable districts of the state, Moradabad was chosen because of its industrial background.,""The intake of services like HIV testing among pregnant women as well as general masses significantly increased in these districts. Also, we traced four to five patients in each district who were HIV positive and required to visit our Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) centre for medication,"" said Menon. ,The UPSACS is planning to impart similar training to 12,000 SHG workers and the remaining 4,000 ASHA and anganwadi workers in these five districts. ""The training of SHG workers in these districts will start in February and complete by April. After this, ASHA and anganwadi workers will be trained,"" said Menon. ,""After October, when the panchayat elections will be conducted, we plan to include half-a-day training about HIV/AIDS awareness in the regular training, which is imparted to the newly-elected gram pradhans. This will be cost effective as well as help us reach the people directly through government bodies,"" he added. ,Till now, the awareness campaigns of HIV/AIDS were restricted to mass media and Information Education and Communication activities of UPSACS.,Meanwhile, the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) organised the second phase of workshops to achieve an epidemiological profiling of districts. The three days workshop, which ended on Sunday, was organised at CSMMU and had participants from 13 states, including Uttar Pradesh, who were trained to compile the data available from various sources and use them intelligently for drawing a focused plan of AIDS control in future. ,""Because of baseline survey conducted across the country in 2006 as well as with functional centers of AIDS control in various districts across each state, we have rich data available on AIDS, and we are in a better position to judge the trends of the epidemic at the district level,"" said Dr Yujwal Raj, Senior Technical Officer (Surveillance), NACO.

Scientists have successfully removed CCR5 — a cell receptor to which HIV-1 binds for infection but which the human body does not need — from human cells. ,Individuals who naturally lack the CCR5 receptor have been found to be essentially resistant to HIV. ,Using a humanized mouse model, UCLA AIDS Institute researchers transplanted a small RNA molecule known as short hairpin RNA (shRNA), which induced RNA interference into human blood stem cells to inhibit the expression of CCR5 in human immune cells. ,The findings provide evidence that this strategy can be an effective way to treat HIV-infected individuals, by prompting long-term and stable reduction of CCR5.,The study has been published in Blood, Journal of the American Society of Hematology.

I don't go to the doctor as regularly as if I were in one place all the time. So I woke up and thought, 'Oh, I'm home in New York. I'm going to see my gyno and I'm getting an HIV test',"" Gaga said.,The 23-year-old star, who is believed to be dating her stylist and friend Matthew Williams, said she has made it her personal mission to make it ""fashionable"" for women to carry condoms and practise safe sex.,""You put that condom in your purse and save your own life.

,,,,The state's first link anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre for prisoners will begin in a week at Arthur Road Jail, thus making it easy for inmates detected with HIV to get treatment. These inmates are now being sent to JJ Hospital for treatment.  ,There are 21 inmates in Arthur Road Jail and one in Byculla Women's Jail who have been tested HIV-positive. They have been put on ART at JJ Hospital after preliminary tests.,The Mumbai District AIDS Control Society, which conducts test and counselling for patients, will launch the ART centre. The society had, in August last year, set up integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTCs) in both the jails.,The Bombay High Court had, in January 2009, directed the state to conduct voluntary counselling and HIV testing for 7,000 inmates of four central prisons at Thane, Yerwada, Nashik and Amravati. A panel was also constituted to study the test results of inmates and submit recommendations. ,The court had taken up the issue in 2008 during the hearing of a bail plea from an HIV-positive prisoner serving life sentence in Pune's Yerwada Jail. It was pointed out 32 HIV-positive jail inmates had died in five years (2001-2006), allegedly owing to lack of proper treatment.,According to data available, around 825 inmates were counselled at the Arthur Road Jail ICTC and 823 tested for HIV. Of them, 41 had tested positive. As many as 375 inmates were counselled at the Byculla Jail ICTC; 258 tested for HIV and 14 tested positive. ""The link ART centre will be attached to JJ Hospital. This will help increase adherence to treatment as there will not be any miss in dosage due to lack of guards to accompany the inmates every month,"" said Dr Harish Pathak, additional project director, MDACS. ,Arthur Road Jail superintendent Rajendra Dhamne promised all help for the project. ""Shifting the inmates to JJ Hospital for specialised treatment could prove fatal. It can now be done in the prison."",Dr Pathak said, ""We have trained jail doctors to detect signs and symptoms of opportunistic infections, like tuberculosis, among HIV-positive inmates."" ,Byculla Jail, however, will not be linked. ""It is practically impossible to start a link ART centre for just one HIV positive inmate. She will continue with JJ Hospital,"" he said.,,,:,,,,,Dependent on their mothers, scores of young children live with them in the Byculla prison, their stay brightened by an initiative by Walt Disney Company (India) Pvt Ltd.,The company has stepped in to help renovate the prison's small 'balwadi' (nursery) and play area, which till recently was in poor condition, prison authorities said. Company sources declined to comment on the initiative.,Some 40 children use the play school. The company has set up new slides and swings next to the area where the children attend pre-primary classes.,""This is a very good initiative. The children stay in the prison as they are dependent on their mothers but we ensure they are never made to feel like they are in one,"" jail superintendent Sudhir Kingre said.,Every morning, between 10 and 12, they step out from their cells, clad in uniforms provided by the prison department, and walk in pairs to the nursery. Two full-time teachers from NGO Seva Niketan give them lessons in Hindi and Marathi. After school, the children play on the premises to show that their freedom is not curtailed.,The play area was redone at Disney's initiative. ""The company approached us in December asking about the facilities on our premises. After finding the project feasible the company agreed to do up the nursery and play area. We have given the garden area for one month to the company for maintenance,"" said deputy inspector general (prisons) Rajneesh Sheth.,Kingre said the company has given soft toys, books, and play school equipment. ""It is having an effect not only on the children but also on their mothers who are lodged in prison for petty offences and who might not have been able to provide quality education."",Most of the children are Bangladeshi, their mothers arrested under the Foreigners Act and waiting deportation. Under prison rules, a child aged up to six can stay with with his or her mother. Kingre says, ""They rarely stay that long; the sentences end earlier.""

,
The state Health department plans to make window period testing for HIV compulsory in blood banks across Gujarat. While HIV testing is presently compulsory at 150 blood banks in the state, window period testing is a relatively new concept followed by only a few organisations in the country. ,As per the plan, Nucleic Acid Test facility will be made available in blood banks across the state in a phase wise manner by the Health department. ,State Principal Secretary (Health) Rajesh Kishore said the Gujarat State AIDS Control Society (GSACS) has been working on ways to reduce the window periods of Transfusion Transmitted Infections. Also, it is looking at technological changes by adopting latest generation testing kits. ,Window period usually lasts for several weeks when newly infected patients do not have enough antibodies produced in the body which can be detected in tests. ,Current tests for AIDS detect antibodies to the virus while for a brief time after contracting HIV, people have a few antibodies to be detected. As a result, their blood passes all the screening tests, even though it can transmit HIV. ,Joint Director of GSACS ,Rajesh Gopal said: ""Adopting latest generation testing kits, technology like Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT) in a cost-effective manner through mobilisation of financial and other resources from all possible quarters can ensure minimising of all possibilities of window period infection."" ,GSACS, meanwhile, is holding a series of workshops for developing a shared vision among blood bankers. ""By encouraging voluntary blood donations over replacement donation, switching over to tube testing with forward and reverse grouping in blood banks only and not at camp sites as well as development of micro-plans in a tri-partite manner to ensure periodic voluntary blood donation at camps to meet the actual requirements of the blood banks in a realistic manner,"" added Gopal.

In a move that will help the state extend its services to people living with HIV and maintain a record of the exact number of HIV positive persons, the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) has invited medical practitioners to join the public private partnership (PPP) model. MSACS will accord the status of Integrated Counselling and Training Centres (ICTC) to private maternity homes/hospitals that perform a minimum of 25 deliveries every month. ,Owing to stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV, most do not openly declare their status, Ramesh Devkar, project director, MSACS, said. Maharashtra, which has a population of 10.30 crore, has 4.5 lakh persons living with HIV.  As many as one lakh people were screened for Anti-Retroviral Treatment (ART) and 60,000 are on medication presently. ,Maharashtra also has the dubious distinction of being the second state in the country with the highest number of orphans and vulnerable children. There are 14,000 such children, Devkar said. The MSACS director admitted at the state level consultative meet held in Pune on stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV that they had not been effective in creating an enabling environment where people could live fearlessly and declare their status. ,""Initiatives like the public private partnership are being encouraged so that we can reach out to more people living with HIV.  This will also help us in recording the exact number of patients who are on ART, Devkar said. Laboratory technicians will be given free training so that they can counsel people to undergo HIV tests. This will help the state to reach out to more people who are living with HIV and ensure services are provided to them, he added. ,Presently there are 678 ICTCs in the state and so far 200 practitioners have registered under the scheme. ,Guidelines that were released on Tuesday last to tackle stigma/discrimination have directed that institutions looking after children with HIV should be linked to HIV programmes being run by the state. They should be given guidance in terms of day-to- day functioning. ""We are developing a crisis-response mechanism in every district and a task force team will be ready if there are any such 'outbreaks' of stigma or discrimination,"" Devkar said.

It's not easy being a woman living with HIV. But as the world celebrated International Women's Day on Monday, several HIV positive women have been declaring their status and a strong network of over 1,000 has been setting up self-help groups and initiating savings schemes for them. ,Manisha, a counsellor with the Access to Care and Treatment programme of Network of People living with HIV in Pune, said 1,826 HIV positive women have registered with the network. ""There are 13 self-help groups and each group has around 15 women who contribute Rs 50 every month. This initiative has helped five groups of women open bank accounts and loan applications are already meeting with approval,"" she said. ,For Satyabhama, life took a different turn after she tested positive for HIV and her husband died of AIDS. She moved to Pune, rented a room, washed clothes and earned a living for the sake of her two children, who had tested negative. Thanks to the support from a growing network of people living with HIV, Satyabhama now works at one of the treatment and care programmes, takes medication and leads a healthy life. ""Over the years, the network has provided solace to more than 1,000 such women and is undertaking a survey to understand their problems,"" says Sanjay Jadhav, administrative officer at the network. ,According to Yuvraj Shinde, programme associate for the Network of People living with HIV in Maharashtra (NMP+) a total of 24,000 women are enlisted on their access to care and treatment programme in the state. The Global Fund for AIDS, TB and malaria has been funding the ACT programme and Rs 40,000 is set aside for each district every month. ,Tejaswi Sevekari, coordinator of Saheli, which works for sex workers, said that earlier it was difficult to bring these women together. Now, a support group has been set up with 100 women and two are being trained to work as peer counsellors. ,Sevekari said their interventions have helped bring these women together. ""They know how to enrol in the Anti Retroviral Treatment (ART) programme and maintain a diary. Earlier, they did not declare their status. But now women are enquiring about each other's health, she said. ,Dr D B Kadam, in-charge of the ART Centre at Sassoon General Hospital, said a total of 5,470 people are on ART and this intervention has helped bring down the viral load. Doctors have also encouraged people living with HIV to follow a nutritious diet, he said. ,HIV+ women registered with the Pune network,all over Maharashtra,self-help groups with 15 members each contribute Rs 50 every month,Network helps women open bank accounts and apply for loans

The AIDS virus, HIV, can dodge treatment by staying dormant inside progenitor blood cells that develop into immune cells. ,These cellular reservoirs are resistant to the immune response of the host and the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) administered to patients. ,This means that the virus can attack white blood cells known as CD4+ T lymphocytes — which help the body to mount an immune response — after treatment. ,""There are so many instances where patients stopped taking drugs and the virus rebounded. There is no way to get people off the drugs,"" Nature quoted lead author Kathleen Collins, a cellular biologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, as saying.,HAART can stop the spread of the virus by preventing the viral genome from integrating into new cells. ,The combinations of drugs used don't attack the cell that makes copies of the virus, but they can prevent the newly made virus from infecting more cells. ,The researchers show that HIV can target haematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) from the bone marrow before they give rise to white blood cells. ,They took these cells from HAART-treated patients who have shown no detectable traces of the virus for at least six months. ,When the researchers forced the cells to differentiate into white blood cells in the lab, they found that the HIV genome in these cells in about 40 percent of the donors. ,They also took cells from the bone marrow of healthy people and showed that the virus killed some cells, but in other cells the virus integrated into the cells'' chromosomes and did not reproduce. ,The cells grew as if they were uninfected by the virus.,""If the drugs are on-board, the virus is still being made but it is not doing much harm because it can't spread,"" says Collins. ,In the absence of the drugs, the infection renews, and patients need to return to the therapy and stay on it. ,""If you shorten the therapy even to two years, that would dramatically change things,"" she said, by bringing down costs and allowing the therapy to be used more widely in poor countries. ,The study has been published in Nature Medicine1.

Until three months ago, operating a photocopy machine was unimaginable for Savitri, 37. Today she can load papers, change cartridges, and calculate the number of blank A4 or A3 size papers required in a month. Simply put, she can run a photocopy machine as a source of income for her family.,It's not just a job for Savitri, who treats this as a source of emotional and financial empowerment through a project with Network By People Living With HIV In Mumbai, also called NPM+. ,Like NPM +, networks of HIV-positive people in 34 other districts have initiated income generation projects under a programme by the Network of Maharashtra People Living With HIV. ,As the women with NPM+ marked Women's Day on Monday, Savitri spoke of her journey since she and her husband had been diagnosed with HIV in 2000. She had been forced to leave her in-laws' house with her ailing husband and four children. Two years later, she lost her husband to AIDS. ,Left to raise her four children, she took up a job as a domestic. ""I earned three to four thousand a month, enough for my children's fees and our household. But last year I seriously fell ill and the doctor advised me to avoid working with water."",She did odd jobs. ""I asked medical social workers at Sion Hospital, where I was on antiretroviral treatment, for jobs; they directed me to NPM+."",Bharti Sonawane, president of NPM+, said their focus had until now been on awareness about HIV and AIDS, access to care and treatment. ""But while offering these services, we realised a lot of HIV-positive women are facing problems seeking jobs,"" she said.,Savitri was then absorbed in a women's self-help group formed by the organisation. ""This group was formed two years ago with the intention of helping women infected with HIV. We realised they need some source of income,"" said Aruna Bere, treasurer at NPM+. ,""If I don't learn it is OK but I want my kids to be well educated,"" said a frail-looking Savitri. Her eldest son, 20, is in engineering college, and the other three are in standards XII, X and VIII. Savitri is happy that now she is doing a less stressful and a dignified job, and that her kids are proud of her. ""My neighbours now talk to me and I have gained a lot of self-respect."" ,Savitri not only operates a Xerox machine but also makes decorative artificial flowers with seven other women in self-help groups. For every 100 flowers she makes, she gets Rs 10. ""I learnt the art of making artificial decorative flowers from a neighbour and now I take orders from a company in Gorai. Though we have the skill to make decorative flowers, what we need to learn is business tactics or communication skills,"" said Rupa, one of the HIV-positive women in the group.

To trace HIV positive patients in the state, the state AIDS Control Society (UPSACS) will train DOTS (Direct Observational Therapy) providers at the village level get tuberculosis patients tested for HIV.,Though the estimated figure of HIV-positive patients in the state is 1,08,000, so far only 47,783 patients have tested positive for the disease. And the figure includes patients who went for the test more than once. ,""Thus, merely one third of the patients are identified and are undergoing treatment,"" said Ramesh Menon, Project Director, State Mainstreaming Unit, UPSACS. ,""Since TB is the most common infection that hits HIV patients, approaching TB patients is a good method to reach out to the HIV positives."",To be held from June to September, the training programme will be conducted in the five 'Category A' districts of the state, where the prevalence of HIV is highest. ,The training will be conducted in batches of forty. Three batches in each district will be trained per month.,""We are expecting to train 300 to 400 DOTS provider in each of the five districts — Banda, Itawa, Devariya, Mau and Moradabad — where the prevalence rate of HIV is very high. Altogether, 2000 DOTS workers and technicians will be trained,"" said Menon.,The proposal, he said, is part of the State Action Plan and once the initiative is approved by NACO, the training will begin.,The DOTS providers will be sensitized to pursue all patients of TB whom they have treated or are treating, for HIV testing, Menon said. Similarly, all lab technicians collecting sputum will be told to direct the patient to the HIV testing labs so both tests can be done simultaneously. ""If any patient tests positive for HIV, they can be directed to their nearest Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) Center for further care,"" he said.,For reaching out people at village level, the UPSACS is already running a first of its kind gramsabha training programme for HIV/AIDS in 100 most vulnerable villages of the five districts. Completed in Banda, Devariya and Muradabad by February end, the programmes will be conducted in Allahabad and Mau in April.

,
Results of a trial of Pfizer's Prevnar 7 vaccine against a major cause of pneumonia and meningitis showed on Wednesday that it can prevent three out of four cases of re-infection in HIV-infected adults in Africa.,British researchers who tested the shot in Malawi found it stopped 74 percent of recurrent cases of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in patients infected with HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS.,The results suggest the vaccine may benefit other high-risk adult patient groups, the researchers said, although the cost -- at around $40 per dose -- may pose problems in poor countries.,""This is the first trial to use a conjugate pneumococcal vaccine in an adult group and find clinical benefits,"" said Neil French of the London school of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who led the study.,""Since it works in patients with HIV infection ... it is likely to work in other adult groups, including the elderly and other at-risk groups."",Prevnar is a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) designed to protect against infection with streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria, which can invade the blood stream and brain and cause invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), in turn leading to the serious and often fatal illnesses of septicaemia and meningitis.,In HIV-infected patients, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, the risk of developing IPD increases is between 30 and 100 times higher, the scientists said in their study in the New England Journal of Medicine.,Similar shots known as pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines (PPVs) are currently used to protect adults in Britain and the United States, but have had limited success in HIV-infected adults and are not recommended for use in Africa.,Pfizer won approval last week for its updated version of the shot, Prevnar 13, which protects against 13 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria, as opposed to the seven tackled by the original.,The original Prevnar was introduced in 2000 and has annual sales of around $3 billion.,GlaxoSmithKline has a rival vaccine called Synflorix that acts against 10 strains, and Merck sells Pneumovax 23, which fights 23 strains and is the only vaccine of its type approved in the United States for adults.,Scientists tested the Prevnar 7 vaccine on almost 500 predominantly HIV-infected adults in Blantyre, Malawi.,Alongside their main finding, they also found the vaccine prevented disease even in HIV-infected people whose immune systems were very weak and who were starting to develop AIDS.,French described this effect as ""remarkable,"" and said it was probably due to the vaccine's conjugate technology.,Polysaccharide vaccines consist of long chains of sugar molecules isolated from the infectious agent -- in this case, the pneumococcal bacteria. But to boost the shot's effect and make a conjugate vaccine, the sugar molecules can be bound to a ""carrier"" protein which magnifies the immune response.,""This gives hope for the possible use of conjugate technology in other vaccines targeting important HIV-associated bacterial infections,"" French wrote in the study.

HIV/AIDS counsellors will now have to be a bit considerate while dealing with the patients. ,At a recent Gujarat State Grievance Redressal Committee for HIV/AIDS meeting on Thursday; HIV/AIDS patients claimed that they are not comfortable when counsellors ask them specific questions. ,Now, the Gujarat State AIDS Control Society (GSACS) has decided to give the counsellors proper training regarding their conduct with the HIV/AIDS patients. ,GSACS Additional Director Dr Pradeep Kumar said: ""According to the Supreme Court guidelines, the state grievance redressal committee is supposed to meet every two months. Health Commissioner Vijay Lakshmi Joshi heads the committee."",Kumar added: ""Two main issues came out at the meeting — one being the conduct of the counsellors. The HIV/AIDS patients are not comfortable with the way the queries are made to them."",He said the manner in which questions are asked about the sexual orientation of the patients will be changed. ,He added: ""There are around 12 Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centres in Gujarat and nearly five more are likely to come up in six months. Immediately, 52 counsellors will be informed about this development and we will conduct the training with the help of the experts, soon."" ,Dr Kumar further said: ""In yet another development, the committee will directly respond to the HIV/AIDS patients in case any complaint is made to it."" ,He added: ""This will be done provided the patient has given his/her name and address to the grievance redressal. If the patient wants to maintain anonymity, the response will be pasted on the notice board of the ART centre nearest to the place from where the letter was posted.""

A week on, there is still no claimant of the body of an HIV positive youth who died in the Civil Hospital on Thursday. ,The 35-year-old man, a native of Joanpur district of Uttar Pradesh, died at the Ahmedabad Civil Hospital Anti Retro Viral Therapy Centre (ARTC), unattended by his family and friends, said hospital sources. The body still lies in the mortuary. This is the second such incident reported at the Ahmedabad Civil Hospital in the last two months. ,""Every month two or three such incidents occur at the Civil Hospital. These are most common with HIV patients or senior citizens from Ahmedabad and elsewhere,"" said Shahibaug Police Inspector J S Panchal.  ,J V Satapara, Resident Medical Officer (RMO) of the Ahmedabad Civil Hospital, said: ""The HIV positive youth was brought to the ARTC by his friend P Datamia. From the information we could gather, we came to know that the youth was working somewhere in Meghaninagar. We will keep his body for seven days and then dispose it off.""  ,He added, ""Sometimes we keep such (unclaimed) bodies for over a month with the hope that their relatives would come."" ,""The youth was brought to the hospital at 12 noon on Wednesday by his friend. He used to come for medication at ARTC. When he died, we tried to contact his brother, but he threw away the SIM card of the mobile phone,"" said an ARTC counsellor refusing to divulge any details about the relatives of the deceased.,Meanwhile, the Gujarat State Network of People with HIV/AIDS (GNSP) and Greater Involvement of People with HIV/AIDS (GIPA) are trying to locate the relatives of the deceased. GNSP Coordinator Pradeep Raval said: ""The deceased was recently detected with HIV/AIDS and was asked to come on February 16. But he came on February 24 in a critical condition. His friends who had accompanied him did not disclose their identity because of the stigma attached with this disease."" ,He added: ""We had spoken to the hospital authorities about performing his last rites. However, they have asked us to wait till March 4. If no claimant turns up, then the NGO would take up the responsibility."" ,Raval further said that HIV positive patients rarely disclose their addresses, which makes it difficult to locate them later. In this case, ARTC records say the victim was from Bapunagar while others say he was working in Meghaninagar.

,
,


,
Preventive use of a cheap, commonly-prescribed antibiotic dramatically reduced the death toll among African patients whose immune systems had been ravaged by the AIDS virus, a media report said on Monday.,The drug, co-trimoxazole, marketed as Septrim, Bactrim and other brands, is widely used to combat pneumonia and ear and urinary tract infections and has also been found to have some antimalarial properties.,The investigation covered 3,179 people in Uganda and Zimbabwe who were started on a course of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and whose counts of CD4 immune cells were lower than 200 cells per microlitre.,Among those given co-trimoxazole alongside the anti-HIV drugs, the risk of dying during the first three months fell by 59 per cent compared to those who were not on the antibiotic.,At the 72-week stage, the reduced risk of mortality still persisted, although it evened out to 35 per cent overall.,In addition, co-trimoxazole cut frequency of malaria by 26 per cent.,These benefits, together with the very low side effects, suggest doctors in Africa should also prescribe co-trimoxazole at the early stage of treatment for HIV, says the report, published online by The Lancet.,""Co-trimoxazole prophylaxis (combined with anti-HIV treatment) is cost-effective and has a substantial public health effect,"" says the study.

,

,

,
,
,

,
In a breakthrough which may pave the way for a vaccine against AIDS, scientists have provided what they claim is the first-ever glimpse of the structure of a key protein, gp120, found on surface of a subgroup of HIV-1.,In addition, the scientists from California Institute of Technology demonstrated that a particular antibody to gp120 makes contact not only with the protein, but with CD4 receptor that gp120 uses to gain entrance into the body's T cells.,This three-dimensional understanding of how gp120 is built is more than just a basic scientific advance, they say.,""There's a tremendous continuing effort to develop a vaccine for HIV and most of those efforts use gp120. Having more structural information will facilitate better vaccine design,"" said lead scientist Ron Diskin.,The team looked specifically at gp120 from what is known as clade C HIV-1.,To explain what that means, here's a brief HIV family history: Most people who get HIV and proceed to AIDS are infected with a member of the HIV-1 family of viruses. HIV-1 is divided into groups; most AIDS-related strains of the virus come from group M. The groups are further subdivided into what are known as clades.,Clade B is the form of group M HIV-1 most often found in the United States and western Europe, and the one that is probably best-studied to date. Clade C, the clade studied by the Caltech team, is ""the one that is devastating Africa and Asia,"" said Diskin. ""It's the one that probably causes the largest number of infections worldwide."" ,In order to uncover the structure of clade C gp120 and determine if the hypothesis about its similarities was indeed true the Caltech team needed to crystallize the protein. That was no easy task. Turns out, says Diskin, the protein itself is not stiff enough for crystallization.,And so the researchers created a complex of molecules consisting of a gp120 monomer, a CD4 receptor, and an anti-HIV antibody known as 21c.,""The most interesting aspect of our structure is the unexpected contact between the antibody and CD4,"" says Pamela Bjorkman, the Max Delbruck Professor of Biology at Caltech, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, and the Caltech team's member.,""The binding to CD4 suggests that this class of anti-HIV antibodies has autoreactive properties, which raises many interesting questions about how anti-HIV immune responses affect an HIV-infected individual,"" she added.,The findings have been published in the 'Nature Structural & Molecular Biology' journal.

In an attempt to fight malnutrition among HIV-positive children, Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS) along with undergraduate students from Brown University , Rhode Island, US, will come up with a nutritional support project at Sion-based Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital's regional pediatric antiretroviral treatment (ART) centre.   ,""Our aim is to identify gaps in the existing programmes and fill them,"" said Gaurie Tilak (19), an undergraduate student. She was at a function to felicitate HIV-positive children and women at Sion Hospital. She announced the commencement of the project. Tilak and her five other friends, part of organisation Aids Relief International (ARI) are trying to raise funds forthe cause. ,Nutrition is a major issue especially among HIV-positive children. HIV causes severe weight loss known as wasting. ""Wasting takes place when body discards necessary nutrients instead of using them. It is very prominent in HIV patients, especially children. Some of the ART drugs also cause wasting. Almost 80 per cent of HIV-positive children have some degree of malnutrition. HIV-positive children children are more predisposed to malnutrition because of recurrent opportunistic infection, bacterial infection and low appetite,"" said Dr Mamta Manglani, incharge of regional pediatric ART centre, Sion Hospital. ,Sion Hospital has 1,327 children registered with the ART centre. Of them, 582 are on ART and the rest are on pre-ART enrolment. ""Priority should be given to the children who fall under pre ART. We need to strengthen their immune system before putting them on ART,"" said Dr Sandhya Kamat, dean, Sion Hospital.     ,""After many rounds of discussion with MDACS, we have decided to provide supplementary nutrition. There are many other areas like transportation for HIV positive people. But nutrition needs to be addressed on a war footing basis,"" said Tilak. ,Starting from June, HIV-positive children under this project will get one kg powder packet that's rich in protein (nachni, mung dal, chana and soybean) along with protein biscuits. ""We will study the changes in them and the findings can then be used to make a policy for the entire country,"" said Dr Manglani.   ,This is the second project in the Sion Hospital to provide food for HIV patients, and first of its kind for the children. ""Sahas, NGO, gives free rationing (pulses, rise and sugar) to HIV positive people,"" said Dr Manglani. ,Asked about National Aids Control Organisation's (NACO) plans to provide supplementary nutrition, Dr Harish Pathak, additional project director of MDACS said, ""NACO is planning to start nutritional programmes across the country.

,,Three years ago, Mukesh Gautam was a dejected man. Having tested positive for the dreaded HIV, he lived a life of stigma, in isolation and with the fear of death. Today, the 6-foot-tall 43-year-old former truck driver is the backbone of the state's recently launched mobile AIDS awareness campaign.,As the mobile Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) van parks itself in colleges, market places or any other locality and Mukesh takes the microphone to speak about HIV-AIDS, its prevention, anti-retro viral treatment and CD4 (cluster of differentiation) counts, most people mistake him for a doctor.,""Just as I announce to the crowd that I am HIV positive, I have noticed the crowds around the van swell,"" he says. The first-of-its-kind effort in the state to involve HIV-positive people to spread awareness about the disease among the public and high-risk groups has been a hit. It has resulted in a record 230 people coming for voluntary tests within the first 20 days, of which a few tested positive. ,""I have now found the best purpose for my life,"" says a beaming Mukesh, who also earns a good remuneration from his new job. Mukesh got to know of his positive status in 2007. So did his wife. Their son and daughter, however, tested negative. ,Inspired by the success of the experiment with the ICTC van, the state is all set to launch a brigade of 200 other HIV-positive people who registered themselves at the two ""drop-in centres"" at Paonta in Sirmour district and Barmana (Beri) in Bilaspur to become volunteers and take the awareness message to the remotest villages of the state. ,Among these 200 people are women and children below 18 years, says Sulakshna Puri, project director of the State Aids Control Society. The state will offer remuneration to them, as most volunteers are from economically weaker sections and have no jobs. The state has 4,218 HIV-positive cases and 735 full-blown cases of AIDS.,""Mukesh's initiative to lead the campaign has been a major success and was appreciated nationally at a meeting held in Delhi last week. The outstanding feature of the current programme is that of the 230 people who came for voluntary tests most are young girls. In Chandi (Solan), at least 63 college girls came for voluntary tests and our aim is to target these students to spread the message of voluntary AIDS test for all men and women planning to get married,"" says Puri. ,Mehar Singh from Mandi, who was earlier a taxi driver, is another HIV-positive person who has made his mark as a trained resource person for doctors. ,Anant Ram (45), a retired havildar from the Indian Army, who tested positive 20 years ago when he was still serving, is a counsellor too. ""My story has inspired many patients and helped them cope up with depression. Though I am an HIV-positive for the last 20 years, I do not require medicine and doctors say till my CD4 count is good I will not require any. I am happy that early detection prevented further transmission of the virus in the family,"" he says. ,Talking about health issues related to HIV-positive status, Mukesh tells his audience that after he tested positive he was also detected with tuberculosis of bones. ""Look at me, I am six feet and was reduced from 80 kgs to 40 kgs. After getting on to ART drugs, I have regained my energy and am all youthful again,"" he tells the youngsters.,The state had earlier introduced HIV-positive people to counsel patients at the drop-in centres. At Paonta, a young woman in her mid-twenties, who had lost her husband to AIDS, was one of the early volunteers. ,A 14-year-old HIV-positive boy from Poanta, who lost his parents and sister to AIDS, is another volunteer for the upcoming campaign. ""After I lost my family, I was thrown out of home by my uncles and my 85-year-old grandmother supported me. Forget education, we could hardly manage two square meals. To become a torchbearer for the campaign is the best I can do to repay the efforts of my grandmother,"" he says.

Now they have approached the state government with demands for support and care. ,Many such HIV-positive women, mainly from the Zari workers community, met State Health Minister Surjya Kanta Mishra on March 15 and submitted a list of demands. Their demands include equal rights, priority in widow stipend, care and support from panchayats and a safe house for HIV-positive women. ,The women also demanded financial support and loans on special interest rate.

There has been a marked decline in the rate of infection among Injecting Drug Users in the state and more HIV/AIDS-stricken people are coming forward to avail of care offered by government agencies, a study has revealed.,The study, carried out by the Nagaland State AIDS Control Society (NSACS) and NGOs working for HIV/AIDS patients, however, rings alarm bail on the increasing use of assorted oral drugs or pharmaceutical drugs among young people, including school children, throwing a fresh challenge to the state.,The trend also revealed that HIV infection among Injecting Drug Users (IDU)s had shown a drastic reduction following massive awareness drive, but more and more cases of spread of the disease through heterosexual route and parent to child transmission was increasing that now encompasses all strata of the society.,According to NSACS data, the state witnessed a drastic decline in the number of IUDs from 1980s and 90s and at present there are an estimated 27,774 of them in Nagaland today.,The NSACS is the nodal agency in the state to coordinate among the government's care and support infrastructure and over 40 NGOs and community orgainsations. ,The NSACS is now implementing the third phase of National AIDS Control Programme (NACP-III) in Nagaland, one among the six high HIV prevalence states in the country with the prevalence rate of 1.20.,Under the NACO's intensive targeted intervention programme and harm reduction strategy, 14 drop-in centres run by NGOs are now functioning in the state providing counseling to drug users who are now coming forward voluntarily to avail of services from NGO workers.,As per records, HIV transmission through needle syringes (IDUs) was about 12 per cent in 2007-08 and it came down to 5.8 per cent in 2008-09, and among the IDUs too the prevalence rate was about two to three per cent.,The NSACS attributed the reduction of HIV infection among IDUs to harm reduction strategy where it advocates for safe behavioural change and expansion of services through drop-in centres.,It claimed 30 TI projects targeting high risk groups such as IDUs, female sex workers, gays, truck drivers and others have helped control the spread to general population.,Dimapur based Bethesda Youth Welfare Society, an NGO dealing with the problem of drug abuse, has found that at present the commonly used drugs in Nagaland are pharmaceutical drugs like Spasmo Proxyvon, Pravosa, Nitrosum and Diazepam.,Besides the oral drugs, the young people, including school children, were now taking inhaled drugs like adhesive, paints and petrol along with alcohol, said Longshi, programme manager of the Society's drop-in centre. ,When we started TI programmes, the number of IDUs must have been around 8,000 at Dimapur but now it is estimated at around 2,000, Longshi said.,But Michael, an outreach worker with Bethesda drop-in centre, pointed out that the drug menace which surged in 1980s still plagued the state.,It was found that most IDUS were often reluctant to reach out to seek services due to fear of being stigmatized and their status revealed. As a result they were deprived of the relevant information and health services to prevent them from HIV and other blood transmitted diseases, he said.,Besides receiving funds from the NACO to launch an all out battle against HIV/AIDS, international donor agencies, including Bill and Milinda Gates Foundation, have assisting the state to control the spread of the disease.,Overcoming all prevailing inhibitions and stigmas, more and people living with HIV/AIDS are coming out open and joining their peers network to assert the rights of getting treatment and counselling from the government created care and support mechanism.,NGOs like the Kohima Network of Positive people underscoring community involvement in the on-going fight against HIV/AIDS, are urging villagers to join various activities undertaken by the infected persons such as counselling and referral, organizing support group meetings at different places or holding sensitization and awareness programmes.

At 85, Bhalchandra Tamboli's spirit is indefatigable. Over the past 14 years, he has been actively crusading for the rights of HIV positive persons and travelling through various districts in Pune to spread awareness about the disease. ,Now, the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) and Pune Zilla Parishad have approved a project under which he can conduct lectures on the subject at district primary health centres. Claiming that he travels nearly 100 kilometres every alternate day, Tamboli says ""Somebody has to take up the cause against HIV/AIDS."" In a letter dated April 1 to MSACS director Ramesh Deokar, Tamboli said he has tried to reach out to as many youngsters as possible in the rural areas and conduct two lectures on the given days at the primary health centres. He has also made clear his willingness to carry on the work for another two years. Tamboli set up an AIDS action committee for senior citizens and regularly prints pamphlets  on facts about HIV. The swine flu pandemic also led the octogenarian to issue and distributed pamphlets about fighting the virus.

,
Ahead of the Shanghai world Expo that is expected to bring a large influx of tourists, China has lifted a 20-year-old ban on entry for foreigners with HIV, AIDS, other sexually-transmitted diseases and leprosy.,The ban, which has evoked a great deal of criticism from home and abroad was removed after gaining more knowledge about the diseases and the realisation that it has a very limited effect in preventing and controlling diseases within the country, a statement by the State Council, the apex body of Chinese central government here said.,The ban has, instead, caused inconvenience for the country when hosting various international activities, the statement reported by official Xinhua news agency said.,The removal of the ban, which was on cards for some time now, was announced as the Shanghai Expo being projected by the Chinese government as its second biggest international event after 2008 Olympics, was due to be inaugurated on May 1.,About 70 million visitors from home and abroad were expected to visit China during the time.,Over USD 58 billion was reportedly spent sprucing the Shanghai city for the six-month long event.,The time ban apparently has been lifted for good as no time frame was mentioned.,In the past it was temporarily lifted for various large-scale events including the 1990 Beijing Asian Games, the Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995 and the 2008 Beijing Olympics.,The candid official admission that the ban had limited effect stems from the fact that China has an estimated 7.40 lakh people with HIV in 2009.,About 49,845 people died of AIDS since the first case was reported in 1985.,The previous ban was imposed in accordance with the ""limited knowledge about HIV/AIDS and other diseases,"" the statement said.,Mao Qun'an, spokesman for the Ministry of Health, said the groundwork for the lifting of the ban began years ago.,The ministry had been advocating lifting the restriction since the Beijing Olympic Games. It took a few more years only because of the necessary procedures.,The development has been welcomed by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who commended President Hu Jintao for the decision.,The lifting of the ban was also welcomed by activists, who said it indicates that the Chinese government had begun treating the disease as a public health issue.,""Previously, China viewed HIV/AIDS as an imported disease related to a corrupted lifestyle. But now the government handles it with a public health perspective,"" Zhang Beichuan, a medical professor with Qingdao University and a front-runner in advocating rights of people living with HIV, said. ,He Tiantian, a woman in her 30s living with HIV and an AIDS activist, said: ""This revision shows us a silver lining, because we have been advocating for the rights of PLWHIV for years, and now we know we didn't do it in vain"".,Meanwhile, the government also narrowed the restrictive scope for mentally ill and tuberculosis patients to only ""severe mental patients"" and those with infectious tuberculosis.,According to the statement, not all tuberculosis diseases are infectious and mental patients would not harm the country's social order and personal safety.,Statistics show that currently 110 countries and regions around the world have no ban on entry for HIV/AIDS carriers.,The US and Republic of Korea both lifted the ban in January.

Laxmi, a 25-year-old eunuch belonging to Mangti sect, earns her living by begging in local trains. Uncertain of her own future after she was detected with HIV four years back, she prays for commuters' good health and financial growth with every clap.,Now Laxmi has a reason to cheer. Mumbai's People Living with HIV (PLHIV) will soon be covered under a unique group medical insurance policy tailor-made for them. The project 'Connect' designed to build public private partnership in combating HIV will be partly funded by NGO Population Services International (PSI). When an insured gets admitted in a Network hospital he/she can go in for cashless hospitalization. ,""I take care of my ailing mother from whatever I earn from begging but if I fall ill there is no one to take care of me. Even if I have small bouts of fever, I end up in a hospital and each visit costs me somewhere between Rs 3,000 and Rs 4,000. All my money goes in paying medical bills,"" says Laxmi.,The scheme will cover PLHIVs attached to Mumbai Network of positive people (NPM+) and other NGO's from Mumbai and Thane area. It involves a private insurance company, Star Health and Allied Insurance, and is supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). ,The scheme is open to a group of 200 PLHIV, with a CD4 count of 300. Initially, the client will get a health cover of Rs 30,000 for which a premium of Rs 1,511 will have to be paid to the insurance company. The policy holder is entitled to pay only Rs 750 and the rest subsidized by PSI. There are two other variations of the policy where one can be insured for Rs 40,000 with a premium of Rs 1,919 and Rs 60,000 for a premium of Rs 2,545. However, the other conditions remain.,""The policy will provide a health cover of Rs 30,000 including Rs 15,000 for hospitalization at the onset of AIDS and Rs 15,000 for treatment of other illnesses like opportunistic infection. It will help provide access to cashless treatment in about 187 private hospitals in Mumbai,"" said Vijay Bhende, co-ordinator for Connect project at Network of Maharashtra People with HIV (NMP+). ,""Last week we received 222 forms with premium amount from PLHIV's in Mumbai and Thane. By this month end, the company will issue insurance policy and insurance cards,"" said K S Mathew, manager Star Health and Allied Insurance Company. ,Like other insurance policies, this one also has exclusions — all diseases and injuries which are pre-existing and contracted in the first 30 days of taking the policy will not be covered. Also there is a 90 days waiting period for AIDS stage benefit. ,""This policy is a major achievement in the fight against the discrimination of PLHIV. The best part is that there is no age limit and covers pre-hospitalization expenses for 30 days, inpatient services and post hospitalization expenses up to Rs 50,000,"" said Bharti Sonawane, president NPM+.,Under the policy, confidentiality of the patient will be maintained. A photo Id card containing ID number, policy number, insurance validity, toll free helpline number and address of the insurer will be issued. HIV status of the person will not be revealed in the insured ID card. ,Experts in the field welcomed the move. ""With introduction of antiretroviral therapy, opportunistic infections have gone down and longevity of HIV patient has increased. Many insurance companies in Britain have offered medical cover with high premium. In USA they are covered both under general and medical insurance,"" said Dr Alaka Deshpande, incharge of JJ Hospital ART centre.,""I need to secure my future. Though the insured sum is too less, it is a beginning towards a life free of discrimination,"" said Laxmi.,The project is running successfully in Karnataka, Andhara Pradesh and 10 districts in Maharashtra including Pune, Solapur, Sangli, Satara, Kolhapur, Yavatmal, Nagpur, Aurangabad and Chandrapur where about 493 people are insured.

In its bid to combat the HIV/AIDS, South African authorities have given 100 free condoms to every person who took an HIV test as the world's worst-affected country launched a campaign against the deadly virus.,Thousands of South African came out to get tested for HIV as the country launched the HIV Counseling and Testing (HCT) Campaign yesterday.,South African President Jacob Zuma launched the  campaign on at the Natalspruit Hospital where he declared that he is HIV negative.,Eighty cubicles from government and the private sector were made available for the general public who wanted to get tested for HIV and other diseases. Each person who got tested was given 100 condoms, BuaNews reported.,All patients will be offered test facility at the entry points in all health institutions.,Zuma himself took an HIV test before the launch of the campaign to encourage people to participate in the drive. ,The campaign, which aims to test 15 million people by the end of June 2011, is aimed at providing anti-Aids drugs to 80 per cent of South Africans in need of treatment.,At least 5.7 million of South Africa's 50 million population are infected.

Even as the number of HIV cases are increasing at a lower rate in the recent years, it is the deaths related to full-blown cases that are now a cause of concern. While the figure of deceased touched an all time high of 115 last year, this year, four persons have succumbed to the virus in three months. ,According to the figures of the state Aids Control Society, 97 died in city hospitals in 2008 while the figure touched 114 in 2007. While the Health authorities say the overall numbers are on a decline in terms of percentage of new cases detected in screening, the HIV cases are now causing fatalities.  ,""The overall trend in the entire country has stabilised. However, deaths related to the disease are rising,"" said Dr Vanita Gupta, project director of the state AIDS Control Society. Another reason, experts said, is the fact that the bulk of cases under treatment are outstation patients from neighbouring states, who land in UT hospitals at an advanced stage.  ,""Barely six percent of cases hail from Chandigarh. Rest are from Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and other neighbouring states,"" said officials. The hospitals records show detection of HIV positive cases has gone down to five per cent in 2009, from as high as 12 per cent in 2006 and eight percent in 2007.  ,,,Chandigarh has a community care centre for HIV positive patients at Khuda Ali Sher, which can accommodate 20 patients. Officials, however, say these facilities are not being fully utilised, as even 20 beds at the centre do not find occupants. ,""Earlier, we had plans to have another centre in the city. But going by the response for the already existing centre and the overall statistics, the plan was dropped by the National AIDS control society (NACO),"" said an official.

,

,

,
,


,
People with HIV reduced the risk of handing on the AIDS virus by an astonishing 92 percent while they were taking antiretroviral drugs, according to a trial reported today.,The research provides the strongest evidence to date that drugs which treat the human immunodeficiency virus could also be incorporated into strategies for fighting HIV's spread.,In a paper published by the British journal The Lancet, doctors recruited 3,381 heterosexual couples in seven African countries.,Each couple was ""serodiscordant,"" meaning that one of the pair was infected with HIV while the other was uninfected.         Antiretroviral drugs were given to 349 individuals after their immune system, as measured by the numbers of CD4 cells, plunged below a given threshold. The other infected individuals received a dummy pill called a placebo.,The researchers took blood samples from the other partner every three months to see whether he or she had become infected. The trial was closely monitored by an ethics committee, and included a training course in safe sex as well as routine health checkups.,After 24 months, 103 partners who had been HIV-free at the start of the experiment had become infected with the virus by their partner.,But only one of these 103 transmissions was caused by a partner who was on antiretrovirals.,The results were confirmed by genetic fingerprinting of the virus, showing whether it had been passed on by an infected partner or by someone from outside the trial.,All in all, taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduced the risk of infecting someone else by 92 per cent, a whopping fall that highlights the potential of these drugs as a weapon to prevent HIV, rather than just treat it, say the authors.,""Provision of ART to HIV-1 infected patients could be an effective strategy to achieve population-level reductions in HIV-1 transmission,"" says the paper. HIV-1 is commonest strain of the AIDS virus.,The benchmark could be when an individual has a low count of CD4 cells and high numbers of viruses in the blood, it suggests. The biggest impact could be among people whose CD4 count is lower than 200 cells per microlitre, if the research is a guide.,ART cuts down the amount of virus in blood and body fluids such as semen and vaginal mucus and so reduces exposure to a non-infected person, experts believe.,There is a caveat, though, say the authors. Even though ART may lower the risk of infecting others, the danger is not eliminated, so safe-sex counselling is essential.

,

,

,
,


,
It is a double whammy for haemophilia patients as they have been found contracting HIV during the course of treatment. According to estimates, there are over 2,200 registered haemophilia patients in the state and over 255 patients contracted HIV in the past decade when they went for repeated blood transfusion. ,The issue has come up as a major cause of concern for the Gujarat State Haemophilia Society (GSHS), but there is no relief for the patients. Dinesh Vadhadia, president, Vadodara Chapter of Haemophilia Society, said: ""Haemophilic patients have to undergo blood transfusions throughout their life, making them highly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS contraction. We had initially taken up the matter with the blood banks, but they shrugged off from the matter saying that every unit is tested."" ,Haemophilia is a genetic disorder, which impairs the body's ability to control blood clotting and coagulation, making it necessary for the patients to require repeated blood transfusion every time there is an injury or bleeding, which can go up to two to three times a month. ,Rajesh Gopal, Jt Director, Gujarat State Council for Blood Transfusion, said: ""No blood is 100 percent safe. The donated blood is tested for at least five infections against the numerous possibilities of infections, which go undetected. In most cases, blood donated in the window period of an HIV/AIDS patient goes undetected of the virus, which poses a problem especially for patients who need to have continuous transfusion of blood. We have been struggling to find a solution to this problem."",But the patients have failed to garner any government support over the issue. ""For the last 10 years, we have been counselling the patients on the odds of blood transfusion and the chances of contracting HIV,"" said Ganesh Javeri, vice president, Gujarat State Haemophilic Society, Surat, where seven patients have contracted HIV. ,GSHS president M A Hussaini said: ""The only option to blood transfusion is doses of Anti-Haemophilic Factor, which has to be taken every time during bleeding. The doses are very expensive and beyond the reach of almost 90 per cent of the patients. So the only option left for them is blood transfusion. Other states like Delhi, Tamil Nadu and UP give patients medicines free of cost.,AHF doses not only minimise the risk of HIV but also protect the patient from being disabled. ""We have submitted a proposal to the government to make the availability of AHF to haemophilic patients subsidised or free of cost but no decision has been taken in this regard. We will submit the proposal again next year,"" said Gopal.

Scientists have claimed that HIV tends to progress at a faster rate in infected individuals who consume two or more alcoholic drinks a day.,According to an important new paper in 'AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses' journal, frequent alcohol use accelerates HIV disease progression -- in fact, two or more drinks a day is associated with declining CD4+ cell counts which indicate a weakened immune system in patients.,Based on the results of a 30-month prospective study, the scientists led by Florida International University, have concluded that alcohol has a direct effect on CD4 cells and that the accelerated decline in CD4+ cell counts in frequent alcohol users is due to drinking.,In their study, the scientists demonstrated that children who were infected with HIV while in utero via maternal-fetal transmission, were subsequently given antiretroviral therapy, and had no detectable HIV in their blood, still produced neutralising antibodies against HIV.,This suggested that low levels of viral replication might still be occurring despite drug therapy, the scientists have claimed.,According to them, the data clearly supported their conclusion that the children's CD4 T-cells may contain latent HIV reservoirs that formed early in life before antiretroviral therapy was initiated.,""It is important that HIV infected individuals make informed decisions relating to alcohol consumption. This article will help to achieve that goal,"" says Thomas Hope, the Editor-in-Chief of the journal.

,

,

,
,


,
In Benson's 14 years of existence, the one constant companion has been death. Apart from his sister Bency. Last month, he lost her too. ,The brother and sister, both HIV-positive, had attracted national attention in 2003 when they were denied admission in a local school in Kerala after the parents of other students protested.,The siblings were only taken back after a public awareness drive, which included photo-ops with celebrities and film personalities, who hugged them to dispel common apprehensions about the disease.,But just when they thought they had triumphed in the battle against discrimination, death snatched away Bency, 16. She had been admitted to a hospital with measles.,At their house at Kaithakuzhi in Kollam, Benson flips quietly through the pages of his sister's funeral album as his grandmother Salamma, 57, sits motionless. In the last 13 years, AIDS has claimed three members of the family.,It all began when Salamma's only daughter Princy married C K Chandy 17 years back. Chandy, who reportedly contracted the disease during his stay in Mumbai, died in 1997. Princy, who had been diagnosed HIV-positive by then, died three years later. The children, Benson and Bency, then came under the care of their grandparents Geevarghese and Salamma. Geevarghese, who had led the fight for the children to be accepted, died in 2005.,As an outcome of the public attention, the siblings got free supply of costly medicine and aid, sponsored by Hindustan Latex Ltd, the Clinton Foundation and the Kerala State AIDS Control Society (KSACS). Bency had been promoted to Class X recently, while Benson is in Class IX.,""Bency had been undergoing the second-line anti-retroviral therapy for the last two years after the CD4 count in her blood came down. She was the first HIV patient in Kerala to get the multi-drug, second-line treatment,"" says Health Inspector M S Biju, who has been deputed to look after the children.,Biju says the CD4 count in Benson's blood too had fallen below 500 in the last medical check-up. If the count does not improve steadily, says KSACS director Dr T V Velayudhan, the boy too would be recommended for second-line therapy. ,Salamma understands that the second-line therapy perhaps signifies the last attempt to protract the life of her grandson. ""Recurring deaths have upset me. Only God knows the pain I am forced to live with... He (Chandy) should not have cheated us like this. Chandy was aware about the disease when he married our daughter. No mother should face this predicament,"" says Salamma, whose only income is a monthly pension of Rs 3,000.,""Although the general public has changed the mindset, our relatives are still afraid of visiting us... I have been looking after the children for the last 16 years without any precautions,"" she says.,Sitting nearby, Benson, back at school after summer vacations, is more stoic. ""I want to live only until God allows me. My only prayer is that my ammachi (grandma) should live to look after me.""

Giving antiretroviral drugs to HIV-infected mothers or giving HIV-fighting syrups to their babies are both effective in preventing transmission of virus through breastfeeding, a major international study has found.,""Our study found that both methods are effective in preventing HIV transmission. The antiretroviral regimen for treating the mothers is much more expensive and requires access to medical facilities that aren't widely available in developing countries such as Malawi, The baby regimen, in comparison, is incredibly cheap and much easier to implement.,""These findings are important because each year about 200,000 infants worldwide become infected with HIV through breastfeeding, and in the developing world infant formula is both prohibitively expensive and associated with increased infant deaths,"" the study's author Charles van der Horst said.,In the study, 2,369 breastfeeding mother-infant pairs in Malawi, were randomly assigned to one of three groups – a maternal antiretroviral therapy (ART) group, a second group in which infants were treated with nevirapine liquid and control group for whom medications were given at the time of delivery only. None of these women had developed AIDS yet and thus did not need treatment for their own health.,After their babies were born, women in the maternal antiretroviral group received a single tablet twice a day containing the drugs zidovudine and lamivudine. They also received a dose of nevirapine by mouth once a day for 14 days and then twice daily from 2 to 28 weeks. ,In the infant prophylaxis group, each infant received a dose of liquid nevirapine by mouth that increased with age, ranging from 1 milliliter a day in the first two weeks to 3 milliliters a day for weeks 19 through 28.,Study personnel measured these doses into syringes which were given to the mothers, who then squirted the contents into their infants' mouths.,Mothers in the study were asked to wean their babies from breastfeeding by 28 weeks after birth and the study results were calculated after each participant in the treatment arms had completed 28 weeks of treatment.,The results showed that infant nevirapine was 74 per cent effective in preventing HIV transmission while maternal antiretroviral therapy was 53 percent effective. In addition, the study found infants had significantly increased HIV-free survival no matter which intervention was used. ,The findings have been published in the 'New England Journal of Medicine'.

A New children's home for AIDS orphans could prove to be a boon for several children like Saloni (name changed), who lost both her parents to HIV/AIDS. Incidentally, Saloni's grandparents are not financially well off to secure the nine-year-old against HIV.,It was a few days ago that a network of HIV/AIDS affected people found Saloni and her grandparents in Kutch district. The association approached the children's home run by the Gujarat State Network of People with HIV/AIDS (GSNP+) and state Social Defense department to support Saloni with nutrition, medication and studies. ,Gujarat is among the few states in India to start the concept of children's home for HIV/AIDS patients this year. ,Two such homes were started this April, one in Surat for girls, and another in Gandhinagar for boys. ,Deputy Director of Social Defence Department, Aruna Dave said: ""The main emphasis for the Social Defence Department for 2009-10 is to provide benefit to the HIV/AIDS positive children. Generally, the government does not provide grants to the grant-in-aid institutions in the first year. But, we are giving 100 per cent grant to the children's home, considering their nutritional and medication needs. The Social Defence Department will also provide scholarships to the children if they pursue their studies. This also applies to those whose parents are HIV positive."",Saloni, who is in Surat now, will be one of the students instrumental in christening the brand new children's home for HIV/AIDS, where she is now residing. ,GNSP+ president Daksha Patel said: ""Saloni cried for her grandparents when she was brought here. But now, she seems settled. Her grandparents were very old and had no money even to buy her the tickets for her journey to Surat."",Patel added: ""The children home will be given a new name soon, so that it gives them the feeling of home. The aim is to make the children in the age group of 1-17 independent, so that they can take care of themselves from the disease. We will take care that the children don't feel and don't mention that they are living in an ,orphanage, to their classmates. We have shortlisted a few names and left it to them to christen it."",The caretakers at the two orphanages are also HIV positive, Patel said.,She added: ""An HIV/AIDS positive couple is taking care of the boys' home in Gandhinagar and one girl is taking care of the girls in Surat. The numbers of students is likely to increase as the schools reopen. At present, there are around 20 children in both orphanages, but their number will increase to 36 as they take school leaving certificates for admission to the children's home."",She further said that as soon as the children join the home, they will be admitted to the new government primary schools and given daily tuition. ,Last year, during a public hearing hosted by state Health and Family Welfare Department Minister Jay Narayan Vyas, the issue about HIV/AIDS positive orphans were discussed. Now, the state government has agreed to provide support to them and sanctioned two children's home.

Police in Pune have arrested the head of a children's home for allegedly selling an HIV-positive baby boy to a couple from Mumbai. The boy died of AIDS-related complications last December.   ,Arun and Anita Yadav, residents of Goregaon in Mumbai, lodged a complaint against Mathew Rayappa Yanmal, director of the Gurukul Godavari Balak Ashram at Yerawada, yesterday.,Police arrested Mathew, 39, this morning and charged him under IPC Sections 420 (cheating) and 406 (criminal breach of trust) after preliminary investigations showed the Ashram was not authorised to allow adoptions, and he had sold the boy to the Yadavs for Rs 1 lakh.,""We are probing if they (the Ashram) have sold babies similarly to others too,"" said Senior Police Inspector Deepak Sawant. ,Anita Yadav, a 45-year-old homemaker, said she and her husband adopted the baby boy after a long wait on March 10, 2009, and named him Ved.,""We were extremely happy,"" Anita said. ""But after a month, Ved started falling ill frequently. We admitted him to Nanavati hospital, and in October, the doctors confirmed that he was HIV-positive. On December 28, he died."" ,""We were stunned and extremely disturbed,"" said Anita. ""Mathew had told us the boy was medically fit. We asked him why he had given us an HIV-infected baby. He promised to give us another healthy baby, but he could not do it. Meanwhile, we found that the ashram had cheated more people like us."",Anita said she and Arun, who works for a private company, had been looking to adopt a baby for a long time. ""Two years ago, I had come to Pune for some work at Sassoon Hospital. There, I met a person called Shiva, who gave me Mathew's number. We decided to adopt a baby from his ashram,"" she said.,""Around September 2008, we gave Mathew Rs 30,000. He promised to give us a baby boy. But months passed and we did not get our baby. After a lot of quarrelling, the ashram people delivered a 14-day-old baby boy to our home on March 10, 2009. We paid the remaining Rs 70,000 to the ashram,"" said Anita. ,A city court today gave the Yerawada police custody of Mathew until June 4 to investigate how and where he got the HIV-infected boy, and whether the transaction was part of a larger child-trafficking racket.,""We don't want our money back,"" said Anita. ""We just want the police to take proper action against the ashram. We have seen many little children there. The police should check if the ashram is taking proper care of them.""

,
Despite the prejudice and discrimination from various sections of society, two HIV positive children cleared the Class X examinations through the national open school system this year. These children were admitted to the Zilla Parishad school at Bhugaon, 12 kms from Pune, four years ago, only to be taken out later because of resistance from parents of other students. Two HIV postive students had cleared the examinations last year. However, the 'vasti-shala' system whereby students at the Manavya orphanage are taught by visiting teachers has its own set of problems. ,One of them, a seventeen-year-old student who has to support his HIV positive brother, has decided not to study further and secured his first job as a helper at an air-conditioner repair shop for a salary of Rs 3,000 per month. Another student is already on the second line anti-retroviral treatment and has to travel to Mumbai for medication. He aspires to be a male nurse with help from the orphanage run by Manavya and has enrolled for training as an auxillary nursing midwife.,The Indian Express had reported on September 29, 2006 how HIV positive children shunned by society were forced to study at a one-teacher school.,""Our experience with these two students at the Bhugaon Zilla Parishad school discouraged us from subjecting them to further humiliation. Hence, at Manavya we decided to opt for non-formal schooling,"" admits Ujwala Lawate, a managing trustee of Manavya, a shelter for orphaned children. ,As of now, the 'vasti-shala' system, implemented by Manavya, has four teachers visiting the orphanage and teaching students from Balewadi to Class VIII. The Zilla Parishad only gives a Rs 800-1,000 per teacher for the project; the organisation has to find sponsors to pay Rs 6,000 to each teacher. ,""Students of Classes IX and X have to rely on self study with volunteers of NGOs helping them,"" said Lawate. ,Despite its best efforts, Manavya has not succeeded in providing an environment entirely free from prejudice against these children. ""We advise them not to reveal their HIV status unless for medical reasons,"" said Lawate. ,Lawate said the government grant of Rs 950 per month per child is not enough to meet medical expenses and other needs. Of the 50 children, 41 are on anti-retroviral treatment and have to travel to the Sassoon Hospital once a month for their check up and medicines. ""One child died in last four years and another student, who could not clear one subject under the open school, contracted tuberculosis and had to undergo a minor surgical procedure,"" said Lawate.

Adoption centres and foster care homes are finding it extremely difficult to place children living with HIV for adoption.,According to Madhuri Abhyankar, director, Society of Friends of Sassoon General hospital (SOFOSH), most adoption centres will have at least one or two children who have HIV. In 2008-09, the number of HIV positive children adopted was nil.,""We could place only one child for adoption a few years ago and that too in a family of doctors who were aware of the problems of  the illness,"" says Abhyankar. Like SOFOSH, other centres, like the Bharatiya Samaj Seva Kendra (BSSK), too find it a challenging task to place HIV positive children for adoption.,Says Roxanne Kalyanwala, executive director of BSSK, ""at present, there is not a single HIV positive child among the 70 at our adoption centre. Couples who have been unable to conceive and finally decided to adopt want a normal healthy child. We have had a few children who had HIV. As they were not placed anywhere, we had to send them to Manavya — an NGO that runs a home for HIV children at Bhugaon."",In 2008-09, a total of 299 children were adopted from eight institutions in the city. A total of 107 were from BSSK, 79 from SOFOSH, 38 from Preet Mandir, 36 from Renuka Mahajan Trust, 18 from Priyadarshini Shishu Gruha, 4 from Pandita Ramabai Mukti Mission and 17 from Sakar. A total of 54 children from these institutions were placed at homes abroad.,Unfortunately, the government does not have a policy for the rehabilitation of such children above 18 years. While institutions send some children to HIV care homes run by NGOs, adoption agencies like SOFOSH has set up its own centre. ""Tara is a specially designed centre where these children can feel they belong and are taken care of,"" says Abhyankar.,District women and child development officer Prashant Shirke said there were very few instances of HIV positive children being adopted. Charitable institutions often take care of the children if they are not adopted but the government does provide funds beyond a certain extent for their care and medical expenses. However, there is no policy for their rehabilitation after they are 18 years old, Shirke admitted.

The Yerwada police have located and detained the biological mother of the HIV-positive baby boy sold by the Gurukul Godavari Balak Ashram to a Mumbai couple in March 2009. The infant later died of AIDS in December. She is likely to be arrested on Saturday,Police identified the mother as Manda Bhimrao Rasal (20), a resident of Nevasa Phata in Beed. Police said Manda had given birth to the HIV-affected boy out of wedlock and then given him to Mathew Rayappa Yanmal, the head of the ashram. ,""Manda also went to the house of Anita and Arun Yadav in Goregaon in Mumbai for giving her the HIV-affected baby to the couple in March last year. The couple paid money to Mathew after receiving the baby. He gave some part of the money to Manda, as she was the biological mother of the baby. Therefore Manda is a co-accused in the case,"" said sub-inspector Dattatraya Raut, the investigation officer.  ""We will also be conducting a medical test of Manda to check if she is HIV-positive. Investigations are also on to identify the father of the baby,"" he added. ,The police have also invoked sections 467, 468 and 471 of the Indian Penal Code against Mathew, for allegedly preparing a forged birth certificate of the baby from the Phursungi gram panchayat to show the orphan as the biological child of Anita and Arun Yadav. ,The Indian Express had reported that after selling the baby, Mathew prepared a fake birth certificate from Phursungi gram panchayat for showing that baby was born to Anita and Arun on February 24, 2009. The certificate also said that Anita and Arun were residents of Phursungi. But the couple said that they had never been to Phursungi. ,Also after it was also learnt that the ashram was not authorised for taking care and protection of children, the police also booked Mathew under relevant sections of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children Act), 2000. ,Anita had lodged the police complaint against Mathew on Tuesday. ,The police then arrested him on charges of cheating and breach of trust. He was then remanded to police custody for two days. On Friday, the Yerwada police produced him before the court, seeking extension of his custody. ,Public prosecutor Kiran Bendbhar told the court that the ashram was suspected of  running a racket of selling the children illegally. Extension of Mathew's custody was required to get into the roots of the matter. Police also wanted his custody to know about the board of directors and other officer bearers of the ashram, who have not been traced yet. Judicial Magistrate (first class) S M Padolikar extended Mathew's custody till June 8. Meanwhile, a Nigdi-based woman whose daughter had gone missing a few months before has approached the police following the media reports on the ashram. She said that a girl seen in the photograph of the children in the ashram, which was published in a newspaper today, was her daughter. Police said that women had lodged a missing report of her daughter with the Nigdi police. Her claim is being investigated.  ,The Yerwada police are investigating whether any staff of the Phursungi gram panchayat is involved in the incident. ""Anita and Arun are not residents of Phursungi. So it is being probed how the gram panchayat staff issued a birth certificate to baby that they adoped from the ashram. We will go to Phursungi gram panchayat to question its staff on what documents they had checked before preparing the birth certificate,"" said sub-inspector Raut.

At the National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) in Pune, scientists are focusing on basic science to understand the HIV virus better. ,Research is underway for a while now to understand at the molecular level the entry mechanism of the HIV virus—in India in particular the circulating HIV-1clade C strains. Once scientists get a clearer picture, it would help design strategies that would effectively kill or block the virus from entering the host cells, says Dr R Paranjape, Director of NARI.,""Under funding from the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India, we have carried out sequencing of genetic material (RNA/DNA) of over 75 near-full-length primary HIV-1 strains and also sequenced HIV-2 Envelope Genes. This will help set up a database of Indian strains and define the molecular characteristics of Indian HIV viruses,"" says Dr Jayanta Bhattacharya, Assistant Director of NARI and a scientist with the Department of Molecular Virology.,In addition, NARI has developed more than 50 functional HIV-1 envelope clones from uncultured patients' blood and these are being studied. ""What is done is genes from the patients' blood are amplified without culturing it in the laboratory,"" says Bhattacharya. He explains that virus culture involves mixing of HIV+ white blood cells (also called peripheral blood mononuclear cells) with white blood cells obtained from a healthy uninfected donor. This helps in growing the virus particles to a detectable amount that can be used for further analyses. ,The virus cultured in the laboratory may not represent the parental virus replicating in the patient. Hence scientists use the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to amplify the genes directly from the patients' blood (precisely from plasma as plasma viruses represent viruses circulating in the body) and then clone them into vectors (vectors are plasmid, small circular DNA) capable of expression in a mammalian cell. The engineered viruses are not infectious but still retain the primary virus surface protein. These viruses are then used for genetic and biological experiments including testing their sensitivity to drugs, inhibitors and antibodies, explains Paranjape. ,Research has shown that HIV-1 clade C strains circulating in India almost exclusively use CCR5 as the co-receptor for entry early during infection. Receptors are cell surface proteins that HIV uses for entering host cells. However, in one recent study, NARI scientists found that the clade C virus from patients could use several co-receptors. They were able to show, in an AIDS patient, that HIV-1 was able to use seven different co-receptors. This perhaps means that in that particular patient the viral surface protein had gone through complex evolutionary mechanisms and adapted to use multiple co-receptors for faster disease progression.,Scientists are now exploring at a micro level how the clade C viruses use CD4 and CCR5 receptors at different disease stages and are examining the relationship between the degree of interaction between the virus and receptors and sensitivity to inhibitors that interferes with viral entry. The latest class of anti-viral drugs licensed by the Food and Drug Administration belong to the category of fusion inhibitors that block the co-receptor, preventing the entry of the virus, says Bhattacharya. ,Such studies will provide a better understanding of the transmission mechanism. They may also throw new light on the mechanism of action of fusion inhibitors, which often fail as a mode of treatment.

Thus, it is very inconvenient for patients from suburbs to travel over such long distances for treatment. We are increasing our outreach to improve accessibility."" The centers will be started at Siddharth Hospital in Goregaon, Shatabdi Hospital in Chembur and M T Agarwal Hospital in Mulund. MDACS president Dr S Kudalkar is meeting the medical superintendents of all three hospitals on Monday, to take the plan forward. ,Since patients in an advanced stage of treatment cannot be moved easily, newly diagnosed patients will be shifted to these centers first. MDACS hopes to inaugurate the new centers in 2-3 months. ,Seven ART centers are currently operational in King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital in Parel, The Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital in Sion, BYL Nair Hospital in Mumbai Central, JJ Hospital in Byculla, Godrej Memorial Hospital in Vikhroli,and Wadia Nursing Home in Parel. Sion Hospital also has an exclusive pediatric ART center.,This extension is also expected to ease the load on existing centers. ""At present we have 53,000 HIV positive patients listed. Though every center should ideally be treating only 2,000 patients, hospitals have had to take in a lot more patients to meet the city's requirements,"" added Dr Patil.

A trial method by the Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS) has helped in early diagnosis of HIV in children born to HIV-positive mothers. Five infants below the age of one year have been identified as HIV-positive in the last two months.,""Children of HIV-positive mothers are a high risk category. Since the regular enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test was found to be sensitive only for a minimum age of one-and-a-half, we decided to try the more advanced DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests through dried blood spot testing, and whole blood sampling methods,"" said Dr SS Kudalkar, president of MDACS.,Since HIV severely lowers the body's immunity, common diseases like diarrhoea kills a lot of such babies. ""Paediatricians were baffled, since no proper cause of death could be identified,"" said Dr Kudalkar.,Not only the paediatric Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) Centre in the Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital in Sion, but also all seven ART centers in the city now provide this test. ""Paramedics have been specially trained in collecting blood from infants and identifying dry blood spots. Paediatricians at all hospitals have also been sensitised,"" said Dr Swapnali Patil, in charge of MDACS's paediatric ART department. ,Samples from all centres are being sent to Kasturba Hospital's lab for testing. All five cases identified so far are on ART. ,""The delay in ELISA test reports meant that treatment also started late, leading to further loss of lives,"" she said.,This comes after the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) and MDACS initiated other measures to improve treatment of HIV-positive children. Free drugs were rolled out through the second line of ART in March, for children who did not respond to the first line of drugs. ""About one per cent of children usually have to be shifted to second-line therapy. Earlier they had to pay for the treatment; since March, the drugs have been made free as per NACO guidelines,"" said Dr Mamata Manglani, head of the paediatric ART centre at LTMG Hospital.,Mumbai's only paediatric ART unit, it has been identified as a regional centre. ""We thought treatment facilities should be made available for children from not just Mumbai, but all over Maharashtra,"" said Dr Patil.,A counselling group, Ankur, has been started for parents of HIV-positive children. ""Just as a school monitors a child's development in parent-teacher meetings, we needed such a mechanism to chalk out the treatment progress of children,"" added Dr Patil.,Three ""link"" ART centres are in the pipeline. These will operate under the supervision of the existing units and will provide basic counselling facilities and drugs. ""The idea is to help people who find it difficult to travel to hospitals regularly. For complex procedures, patients will still have to go to the primary ARTs,"" said Dr SS Kudalkar, president of MDACS.,Two of these are being planned for special target groups, one for sex workers from Kamathipura and the other for Wadala residents with HIV as well as TB. ""Sex workers and their clients will find it convenient to have an ART centre right at their doorstep. HIV-positive patients who catch TB are so weak that travelling often is not possible,"" said Dr Swapnali Patil, in charge of MDACS's paediatric ART department.

,
Scientists at National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) are keen on finding out how H1N1 infection can affect 'immuno -compromised' and high risk group of people living with HIV. Last year six persons living with HIV had fallen prey to swine flu and related complications. , From January this year when the epidemic was not at its peak, a total of 2,360 HIV patients were examined at NARI's six clinics in the city and 40 were identified with severe symptoms like cough, fever and cold. However, the prevalence of infection among HIV positives was nil. , Cases are likely to rise due to changing weather conditions and now scientists at NARI are planning to examine HIV patients at the clinics and collaborate with National Institute of Virology to test the throat swabs. Dr RS Paranjape, director, NARI, told The Indian Express that World Health Organisation (WHO) had listed people living with HIV as one of the high risk groups who are susceptible to various infections. Hence NARI will conduct a battery of tests and identify those who are at a risk due to the virus. , ""How does H1N1 virus contribute to the morbidity in an already immuno-compromised HIV patient? Are they going to be seriously ill, how many get better and recover with Tamiflu are just a few of the research aspects that will be looked into,"" said Dr Sheela Godbole, assistant director,  NARI.  During the period of six months we conducted a pilot study (January-June) the transmission of the H1N1 virus was low and not spreading like before during the period of August -December 2009. So the threshold of transmission is also one of the aspects that will be looked into, said Paranjape.  , According to the NARI director preliminary findings have shown there were no H1N1 cases among HIV infected patients when the transmission was low. Hence the monsoon period will be critical. The institutions will also collaborate with Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) where doctors have been told to send HIV patients with symptoms of swine flu to NARI clinics for examination. The clinics are located at NIV, Gadikhana, Ganesh Peth, Talera Hospital at Chinchwad, NARI at Bhosari and Model Colony. Godbole said that various tests will be conducted to check swine flu, dengue, malaria and other bacteriological infections.       	,,,,,While HINI virus is a cause of concern for health officials who have registered over 200 cases in Pune district from April this year with 33 deaths, they are also focusing on viral diseases that crop up during monsoon every year. With 97 cases of malaria being registered in  Pune district from April till June this year,  state and district health officials have urged that spraying of pesticides is not enough to control the mosquitoes menace. There is an increasing need for people to adopt preventive measures.,Dr V D Khanande, joint director, health, told media persons on Thursday as part of the national vector borne disease control programme, the government has launched awareness campaigns to control the spread of diseases like malaria, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, chikungunya and Chandipura virus. Anti-malaria month is observed every year in June throughout the country, prior to the onset of monsoon and transmission season to enhance the level of awareness and encourage community participation through mass media campaigns.,At present, about 2 million cases and 1000 deaths are reported in India annually, about half of which are Plasmodium falciparum ( P. falciparum ) cases, which is a major concern, as it often leads to complications, if not treated early. In Maharashtra, there were 98,199 cases of malaria in 2009-2010, while till May this year there were a total of 11,650 cases of malaria. A total of 227 people died due to malaria in 2009-10. Last year, Pune district witnessed 654 positive cases of malaria, while 97 were registered in the last two months.,Meanwhile, there were a total of 7,339 cases of dengue in 2009-10 in the state. Out of this there were 92 positive cases of dengue in Pune Municipal Corporation area, while 788 were from Pimpri Chinchwad area. In 2009-10, there were 20 deaths due to dengue, Khanande said.

A fourth anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre in the city, to be launched by National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) in Model Colony on July 1, has raised the hopes of many living with HIV who were earlier deprived of free medication. ,NARI director Dr RS Paranjape said interventions had brought about a decline in the number of new infections among women attending the ante-natal clinics. ""Several studies in south India are showing this trend. But, there is a need to provide free medication to patients."" ,The ART centre at NARI clinic in Bhosari has been providing drugs to 700 people. ""At our Model Colony centre, we hope to provide drugs to around 2,000 people,  which will include the 700 who are on treatment."" ,However, the wait list is long. As many as 21,381 have registered for anti-retroviral therapy at Sassoon Hospital. Doctors said the treatment would begin only after tests show a drop in their CD4 count levels. The ART centre, set up five years ago, has 5,642 patients on medication now. ,Officials said over 9,000 people have been shifted to the link ART centres  at Satara, Solapur, Ahmednagar, Nashik and other places. As many as 798 patients have dropped out of the programme. There have been 883 deaths of people who were on ART in five years; they had succumbed to opportunistic infections. There has also been an increasing demand for second-line ART drugs, and 125 have been referred to JJ Hospital, Mumbai. ,""Anti-retroviral therapy has the potential to increase the life expectancy of people living with HIV,"" says Col K Shanmuganandan, in-charge of the ART centre at Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC). The AFMC had started its ART Centre a year ago and nearly 2,000 are on medication here. YCM Hospital, Pimpri, also has an ART centre.,Institute of Infectious Diseases director and private practitioner Dr Sanjay Pujari said there was a need for more drugs as the treatment guidelines were constantly changing. ""At present, ART is given to those whose CD4 count is less than 300 or 350. There are countries where medication is started irrespective of the CD4 count.""

Expressing concern regarding the rising number of addicts using intravenous drugs in the region, the Society for Promotion of Youth and Masses (SPYM) presented its study on Thursday.,As per the comparative study conducted in north-east and north-west parts of the country in 2009, the menace is spreading fast in Punjab, Chandigarh and Jammu, recording a high percentage of drug users who are HIV positive. The areas included in the north-west region were Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab. The north-eastern region included Mizoram, Nagaland and Manipur.,Rajesh Kumar, institutional director of SPYM Delhi, said the north-west cities were found to have a higher percentage of HIV positive intravenous drug users (IDUs), with Punjab having 13.8 per cent of the infected people and Chandigarh 17.6 per cent. ""Many IDUs in the country are married, which makes their spouses vulnerable to the virus. The burden of drug use by men on their wives and children in India has not been studied adequately,"" he said.,As many as 55 people from Chandigarh, Jammu and Patiala were taken as sample for the survey and the following criteria was used: Recruitment (husband an IDU and his wife), consent (from the participants) and then a referral to various services (like HIV testing).,According to a demographic survey, HIV-infected men in the cities were generally in the age group of 24 to 52 years in north-east region and between 20 to 56 years in north-west. Most infected IDUs were either self-employed or skilled workers.,Of them, only 66 per cent from north-west knew about the spread of HIV virus through sharing of contaminated needles, as compared to 97 per cent from north-east .,""Counselling plays an important role in strengthening the will power of IDUs. Thus, the SPYM now plans to have more targeted interventions. One such step is the oral substitution therapy, under which the IDUs are encouraged to use smaller quantities of legal drugs and the use is finally tapered down to nil,"" said Kumar.

An HIV positive woman who was turned away by doctors at a government hospital in Sehore district delivered a stillborn baby in Bhopal. The doctors in the district hospital in Sehore allegedly refused to perform a Caesarian operation on the woman.,An inquiry has been ordered into the sequence of events that began with the admission of the woman, a resident of Muvada village in Ichhawar block, in the Sehore hospital on Thursday. The doctors, initially unaware of the woman's HIV status, allegedly asked her relatives to take her to another hospital once they came to know of it. ,Civil Surgeon Dr T N Chaturvedi, the head of the hospital ordered an inquiry into the matter and said that it was a clear case of negligence. Dr Bharati, a senior doctor on duty when the incident took place, claimed the woman had refused to cooperate for normal delivery, which led the doctors to refer her to Bhopal.The woman was first taken to the Hamidia Hospital and then to Sultania Hospital.

Enthsed by the success of vaginal gel that can reduce the risk of infection among women with HIV by 39 per cent,  National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) is identifying sites in Pune, Mumbai and Karnataka for clinical trials of similar tenofovir containing gels. ,""NARI would definitely be interested in testing the product and we are submitting our plans to commence work soon,"" said NARI director Dr R S Paranjape. ,""The ongoing international AIDS conference at Vienna has announced the results of the vaginal microbicide gel that was tested in Africa in over 800 women and helped reduce the risk of HIV infection by 39 per cent. The implications of this study are enormous,"" said NARI deputy director Dr Sanjay Mehendale. ,""However, such a gel would hit the market an around two to three years,"" Scientists said. ""Hence, further studies is important,"" said Paranjape. ""A similar trial had been undertaken in Pune three years ago and Phase 1 studies showed the gel was safe. However, we have not proceeded with the trial,"" he said. Dr Smita Joshi, who was involved in NARI's clinical trial, said the vaginal microbicides will help women protect themselves against HIV and some sexually transmitted infections when they cannot negotiate condom use by men. NARI has been involved in the clinical trials on vaginal microbicides since 1998. The institute has conducted four Phase 1 studies (N-9, buffergel, PRO 2000 and Praneem) and one Phase II study using Praneem polyherbal tablet. ""However, there has to be several consultations with experts on the tenofovir gel product that has to be tested,"" said Paranjape. It will be tested among the high-risk group of commercial sex workers in the country. ,""A meeting has also been convened on the future of microbicides in New Delhi,"" said Dr Badri Saxena, chairperson of the expert group of the Indian Council of Medical Research on microbicides.

Three thalassaemia patients tested HIV positive and another 16 tested positive for Hepatitis C — all after free blood transfusions at the government-run Umaid Hospital in Jodhpur. ,The startling discovery came to the fore after tests were conducted on 50 thalassaemia patients by the Marstyawar Thalassaemic Society (MTS).,MTS secretary Vipin Gupta said, ""We conducted tests on more than 50 patients who received blood transfusions in the last 15 months and three were found HIV positive and another 16 with Hepatitis C."" ,He added that the tests were conducted at the S N Medical College, where an earlier test of thalassaemia patients in December 2008 had exhibited a similar medical neglect. ,""Then, five children had tested HIV positive and around 20 tested positive for Hepatitis C,"" Gupta said. ,However, Dr R K Aseri, principal of the S N Medical College, said the Umaid Hospital follows all guidelines as laid down by the National Aids Control organisation (NACO). ""NACO rules stipulate five compulsory blood tests from donors for HIV, Hepatitis C and B, syphilis and malaria and the Umaid hospital follows all these rules,"" Aseri said. He added that thalassaemia patients required close to 20 transfusions a year. ,Gupta does not doubt the hospital's facilities and blames the government for not introducing better testing techniques. ""The present test for HIV is ELISA, with a window period of 50 days. This is the number of days after which the disease can be detected. However, there is now a Nucleic acid based tests (NAT), which brings this window period down to 11 days,"" Gupta said. He added that the government had even set up a committee to look into introducing this technique in February this year. ,Senior government officials from the health department said they had received a proposal to set up NAT facilities in hospitals, but was never taken forward. ,Principal Secretary, Medical Education, C M Meena said, ""We have to follow NACO guidelines when it comes to blood tests and we believe the NAT technique is not as foolproof as ELISA and also far more expensive."" He added that the related machine costs close to Rs 3 crore and Rs 1,000 per test. ,But Gupta is not convinced. ""If the government claims that the NAT technique is not foolproof, then how come the best hospitals in the country like AIIMS and the Army Hospital use it. In Rajasthan, there is only one hospital, which has NAT facilities,"" Gupta said.

,

,


,
The Delhi Government has told the High Court that there is no government hospital in the city which can provide maintenance dialysis to HIV positive patients. As if this was not bad enough, the affidavit says there are no private hospitals either where they could receive the treatment. ,The court had earlier asked the government how many government hospitals could help HIV patients, especially those belonging to the poor strata of the society, get the treatment. Justice S Muralidhar had also wanted to know whether it was possible to have a ""referral system"" so that patients could be referred to a private hospital obligated to provide free beds to the poor.,The government affidavit, however, disclosed that while the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Hospital has a functioning haemodialysis unit, it did not have trained staff to deal with HIV positive patients. ,Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital provided dialysis, but not the maintenance dialysis needed by HIV positive patients in aseptic conditions. ,In its response, the Central government said two of its hospitals, AIIMS and Safdarjung, had the facility, but that was certainly not adequate keeping in view the persistent dialysis requirements of the patients and the number of such patients in the city. ,Unhappy with the state's response, Justice Muralidhar asked the government if it could have a system where the patients could be sent to any of the 39 private hospitals established on land given on concession or under joint venture agreements with the government. ,After enquiring with the hospitals, the government submitted another affidavit which says none of them were in a position to help HIV patients get maintenance dialysis. ,Significantly, most of the private hospitals completely ruled out the possibility of having the system, saying it was ""not feasible"" to have dialysis for the poor. Apollo, the only private hospital with the facility, clearly said ""it was not possible to accommodate any more patients"".,Justice Muralidhar said this indicates a dismal picture as regards availability of maintenance dialysis facilities to HIV positive patients and asked the Centre to convene a meeting with the Delhi Health Secretary and the medical superintendents of major hospitals in the Capital and work out an action plan within three weeks. The authorities have been asked to draft a report on the proposed plan by then and submit it in the court by August 12. ,The matter came to light after a relative of an HIV positive patient filed a PIL in court alleging they were facing acute problems because of lack of maintenance dialysis facility in city hospitals.

,
,,,,The prevalence of HIV cases among high-risk groups in Chandigarh slums, especially among injecting drug users (IDUs), is very high — from 4.8 per cent in 2004 to 17.60 per cent in 2006. ,This was stated in the book Chandigarh Slums: Issues of Poverty and Human Rights written by Dr Bindu Duggal, a researcher at Centre for Research in Rural and Industrial Development (CRRID), who has conducted a study of slums in the city. UT Administrator and Punjab Governor Shivraj Patil released the book today.,According to the study, the percentage of HIV positive cases in slums has been increasing at an alarming rate over the last few years. It says the prevalence of HIV cases among MSM (men who have sex with men) in the slums increased from 1.36 per cent in 2004 to 4.80 per cent in 2006. The prevalence of HIV cases among female sex workers, meanwhile, has increased from 0.40 per cent to 1.60 per cent during the same span of time.,It was also observed that most of IDUs were males. Therefore they carry the risk of transmitting HIV to their female partners. ,Majority of the drug users are youth between the age group of 15 and 25 years. Children in the slums are also becoming drug addicts due to the easy availability of drugs.,It further states that 52.5 per cent of the population living in slums is suffering from more than one ailment. Skin problems formed 29 per cent of the reported cases of illness. The prevalence of tuberculosis is 15.22 per cent. The other diseases include blood pressure, diarrhoea, pneumonia, blood pressure and so on. ,Among the most vulnerable section were women and children. For treatment majority of the population in slums either consulted quacks or resorted to home-based remedies.,The number of slum-dwellers in the city have increased over the years. From 8,003 in 1974 to 9,488 in 1980, the slum dwellers in the city in 2006 according to figures of the UT Administration were 23, 841. In the last four years, the numbers have exceeded this figure.,Slums mushroomed in the city because of the policy failures. One of the major drawbacks was the lack of provision of housing for poor migrants in the master plan of Chandigarh. Efforts at rehabilitation were piecemeal and ad hoc. Partial rehabilitation of slum-dwellers resulted in multiplying those left behind. There have been instances of allottees selling houses given under the rehabilitation scheme and returning to the slums.

The Government of India has appointed Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (ILFS) to engage outreach workers across the country to convince all HIV Positive patients to get treatment in civil hospitals. Health Secretary Satish Chandra, who was in Zira to participate in the state-level International Youth Day programme, said this on Thursday. ,These outreach workers are HIV Positive patients appointed by the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) who go in the field and convince other such patients to get treatment instead of hiding themselves and their disease. The project was started by NACO in December 2007 but the outreach workers were expelled from their jobs in December 2009 without being given any reason. They were being paid a monthly salary of Rs 2,500. ,Chandra said: ""It's a Government of India project and the decision to appoint outreach workers and expel them was taken by the Centre. But my office recently received a communication that says an agreement has been signed by Government of India with the ILFS to run this project. It will be now run in a bigger way and more workers are likely to be appointed."" In civil hospitals, HIV patients are given free treatment under the national project.,In Punjab, six outreach workers were appointed and they were working under the State AIDS Control Society. They have expressed willingness to provide their services. ,Satnam Singh Dhaliwal, president of the Universal Human Rights Commission, said: ""After the expulsion of outreach workers, the project has come to a standstill. Patients still consider this a taboo and don't come forward for treatment easily. The government must restart it at the earliest."" ,According to Chandra, a total of 21,966 HIV cases have been registered in Punjab since 1999. Dhaliwal, however, said the number could be more as all patients do not come forward for treatment.,The health secretary said the department had plans to recruit 250 more doctors and Rs 350 crore would be spent on the upgrade of facilities at medical colleges. Apart from this, a Rs 5.5-crore budget has been sanctioned for Makhu Civil Hospital in Zira constituency.

A mother-in-law fighting for her daughter-in-law, who was HIV+ and was denied rights in the family, a husband who supported his wife selflessly when her immune system collapsed, and ward boys working beyond duty hours to look after patients in Anti Retroviral Therapy centers — these are stories of people who took care of their HIV+ loved ones. Compiled into 15 series, a radio prgramme on HIV positive people from the heart of Maharashtra is ready to go on air.,""Maintaining a positive outlook is crucial. For every person who is stigmatized, there is one who is not,"" was the message from a member of the Maharashtra network of (HIV) positive people, introducing the radio programme. ,Produced with the help of NGO Communications Hub, and recorded in Marathi, the programme will be broadcast every Saturday between 7.30 am and 8 am all over Maharashtra. The series was inaugurated at the recent World AIDS Conference in Vienna, and judged as the best initiative in stigma reduction. Funded by a grant from the World Bank, Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (MSACS) is overlooking its broadcast at AIR. ,Explaining the concept, Sonalini Mirchandani, Chief Executive of Communication Hub, said, ""We were overwhelmed by the stories we got. From our side, we just provided training on the technical aspects of radio production — the rest as they say is history."" HIV+ people from districts like Solhapur, Satara, and Dhule took charge, recorded their stories and e-mailed them to the technical team in Mumbai. ,Another member of the Positive People's Network points out that the stories should be looked at as journalistic endeavors and not as radio dramas. ""Every interview is in the words of people who faced discrimination, and those who supported them. Only the music and the narration has been put together in Mumbai."" ,The project has inspired MSACS to plan a similar TV programme. ""We are already broadcasting a dial in show, where people with AIDS related queries can call. One show has already gone on air in Doordarshan, Maharashtra,"" said Information Education and Communication in charge at MSCAS, Ashwini Jathar. She added that there are plans to expand this weekly programme to include real stories. MSACS will also roll out its first IEC initiative to target tribal people exclusively on AIDS awareness. Eight districts with high migration rates among tribals have been identified for this intervention. ""Yavatmal, Nandurbar, Chandrapur, Nanded, and Ahmednagar are some districts where capacity building exercises will be conducted for tribals, in collaboration with their respective gram panchayats. School teachers and other advocacy groups will be specially trained in these areas. ""We have also chalked out a plan to spread awareness through wall paintings, depicting stories of HIV positive people, in these districts,"" added Jathar.

When deputy regional transport officer Anil Valiv from Solapur set up www.positivesaathi.com — the country's first matrimonial website for HIV-positive persons — little did he know that the response could be so overwhelming. On Sunday, the Agrasen Bhavan Hall at Raviwar Peth saw over 150 HIV-positive persons gathering together in the hope of finding a suitable life partner and  at least 10 marriages were reportedly fixed at the meet.,Valiv had provided the travelling expenses to around 50 women who came from as far as Gondia, Yavatmal and even Raipur in Chhattisgarh for the meet, for he feels HIV-positive women — especially widows — need to be encouraged to come forward and voice their expectations about remarriage. The meet was organised by Wake Up Pune — a group of NGOs engaged in creating awareness about HIV — and organisers of Pune Zilla Agarwal Yuva Sammelan, aarogya.com and positivesaathi.com.,The parents of a 22-year-old woman from Ganesh Peth waited the entire day at the hall in the hope of finding a suitable match for her. ""My daughter's husband died of AIDS two years ago; she has the virus,"" said her father, a tailor. ""These meetings are a positive step as we can come here without the fear of any stigma."",For another 26-year-old working woman from Mumbai, the meeting was also an opportunity to meet other like-minded people. ""Even if I am working in Mumbai, my employers are not aware of my HIV status,"" she said in fluent English. An HIV positive widow with no children, she had also registered her name on the website and decided to try her luck in finding a life partner.,Urvashi, an HIV-positive widow from Hadapsar, who struggles to make ends meet with a six-year-old son was hoping to meet a widower with children at the meet.

Thirty-year-old Vimal Khandare from Tadiwala Road is today more confident of handling her HIV status after she was diagnosed with the virus in 2006. ""I had to take anti-retroviral drugs and soon recovered with a good nutritious diet. The support group meetings also helped me fight the stigma,"" said  Khandare. He attended the meeting of the support group set up by Society of Friends of Sassoon General Hospital and department of paediatrics at Sassoon General Hospital. ,The monthly meeting of the support group had over 100 people, mainly HIV positive widows, a few men and ten persons who had lost their sons and daughters-in-law to the virus. They now look after their orphaned grandchildren and find the meetings of the support group a blessing as it helps them deal with HIV related complications, said Asha Kanade, in charge, support group run jointly by SOFOSH and the department of paediatrics. ,According to Dr Arti Kinikar, head,  department of paediatrics, Sassoon General Hospital, a study done on 110 orphans showed that HIV/AIDS related mortality has a negative health and socio-economic impact on them. There is high incidence of development delay, repeated hospitalisation, school drop outs, severe malnutrition and incomplete immunisation among the HIV positive orphans, according to the study. 'HIV/AIDS orphans- The silent sufferers', the study conducted  by the department, was submitted in the form of a poster at the recent AIDS conference at Vienna.. ,The study was conducted on 55 HIV orphans and 55 orphans who did not have HIV to compare the demographic, social and health related characteristics of HIV positive children who had lost one or both parents to HIV/AIDS to orphaned non-HIV positive children. These children were mainly from slum areas of Pune and rural parts of the district who visited Sassoon General Hospital's paediatric department for treatment. ,According to Kinikar, the immunisation status of children without HIV was better than that of the HIV orphans. Most of the orphaned children are below five years of age and more than half the caretakers are illiterate making it difficult to take care of the HIV orphans. Some of the caretakers are elderly  who are tackling their own problems. Lack of basic knowledge  leads to poor immunisation and nutrition leading to repeated hospitalisations and finally school dropout of the affected child, said Kinikar who has done the study along with SP Adhav, S J Bothra and VM Mave. ,There was a need for a comprehensive approach in dealing with HIV/AIDS families. The Society of Friends of Sassoon General Hospital has set up a support group to help caretakers of the HIV orphans. ,""The response has been increasing in the last few years after the availability of anti-HIV drugs,"" said Kinikar. The support group for caretakers meets once a month and provides guidance regarding nutrition and check up of the HIV orphans, added Kinikar.

A study carried out by the paediatric department of Sassoon General Hospital has revealed that HIV/AIDS related mortality has a negative impact on health and socio-economic life of HIV orphans. There is a high incidence of development delay, repeated hospitalisation, dropping out of schools, severe malnutrition and incomplete immunisation among the HIV positive orphans, the study says. ,The department had sent its study in the form of a poster 'HIV/AIDS Orphans-The silent sufferers' to the international AIDS conference at Vienna recently. Dr Aarti Kinikar, associate professor and head of the Department of Paediatrics, Sassoon General Hospital, told The Indian Express that there was a need for a comprehensive approach in dealing with HIV/AIDS families. Along with the Society of Friends of Sassoon General Hospital, a support group of caretakers of the HIV orphans has been set up. ,The study was conducted among 55 HIV orphans and 55 orphans who did not have HIV. The children were mainly from slum areas of Pune and rural parts of the district who visited Sassoon 's paediatric department for treatment. ,According to Kinikar, the immunization status of children without HIV was better than that of the HIV orphans. Of the 55 HIV orphans, 11 were staying with relatives, 31 lived with their mothers as the fathers died of AIDS while 13 children lived with their fathers. Twenty six girls below 18 years of age were married and were infected with HIV. There were 16 girls in 18-21 age group and were infected with the virus after marriage. Among the HIV positive fathers, 32 youngsters were between 18 and 21 years of age. ,While most orphaned children are below five years of age, more than half of the caretakers, including grandparents, were illiterate. Besides, they have their own problems like diabetes and cataract. Lack of basic knowledge of HIV care leads to poor immunization and nutrition care, said Kinikar who has done the study along with S P Adhav, S J Bothra and V M Mave. The support group for caretakers meets once a month and provides guidance regarding nutrition and check-up of HIV orphans, said Kinikar.

,

,

,
,
,

,
The non-stick coating of protein in semen cuts the rate of infection of immune cells by HIV, a new study has found.,The new material is a potential ingredient for microbicides designed to reduce transmission of HIV, found a team from the University of Rochester Medical Center and the University of California, San Diego.,The coating clings to fibrous strings and mats of protein called SEVI–for semen-derived enhancer of viral infection–which was first discovered just three years ago. ,SEVI seems to attract the virus and deposit it onto the surface of T-cells, components of the immune system that are the primary target of HIV infection, and may play an important role in sexual transmission of HIV.,Like the fibrous strings that bind senile plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease, SEVI is a kind of protein superstructure called an amyloid.,Jerry Yang, associate professor of chemistry at UC San Diego and his research group developed non-stick coatings for amyloids as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease in 2006. ,Their idea was to minimize damage by preventing amyloid proteins from interacting with other molecules in the brain.,After the discovery of this new amyloid, SEVI, Yang wanted to test whether the coating strategy might interfere with SEVI's role in promoting HIV infection.,""We tested one of our molecules out on SEVI and found it was able to stop SEVI-enhanced infection of HIV in cells. It works in semen too. Something in semen enhances viral infection – SEVI and maybe other things. This molecule stops that,"" said Yang. ,When the researchers added the molecule that forms non-stick coatings to a mix of SEVI, virus and cells, rates of infection dropped to levels observed when SEVI was absent. ,They saw a similar effect with semen as well, evidence that this potential microbicide supplement works to inhibit infection within a mixture of proteins and other molecules found in seminal fluid.,The coating molecule is a modified form of thioflavin-T, a dye that stains amyloid proteins. It fits in between the individual small proteins that cluster to form SEVI and blocks SEVI's interactions with both the virus and the target immune cells.,""Other people have tried to do the same thing by targeting the virus or the cells it infects. What we do is target the mediator between the virus and the cells. By neutralizing SEVI, we prevent at least one way for HIV to attach to the cells,"" said Yang. ,The new molecule has another advantage. Unlike many current microbicide candidates aimed at reducing HIV infection, this one doesn't cause inflammation in cervical cells.,""Recent studies have shown for the first time that a topical microbicide gel can protect women from HIV-1 infection. This is a huge step forward but not a perfect solution. We need to figure out ways to further improve protection - and our studies suggest one way of doing so. It may be possible to produce a next-generation microbicide that includes both an antiviral agent, as has been used in the past, and an agent that targets SEVI. We're very excited about exploring this idea,"" said the corresponding author of the report. ,The study has been published in a forthcoming issue of the Journal of Biological Chemistry.,,

,

,

,
,
,

,
Australian scientists have discovered how the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) keeps a grip on the human immune system that renders any anti-HIV treatment incomplete.,They explain that the virus hides dormant versions of itself in a reservoir of cells and ""wakes up"" in the future to attack the immune system, reports said.,""These silently infected cells are not cleared by anti-HIV drugs or the immune system (meaning) once a patient stops the anti- HIV drugs, the virus can then wake up and gets going again,"" said Professor Sharon Lewin of the Burnet Institute''s Center for Virology and Director of The Alfred''s Infectious Diseases Unit, as saying.,""We have shown that a family of proteins, called chemokines, that guide resting cells through the blood and into lymph node tissue can ''unlock the door'' and allow HIV to enter and set up a silent or ''latent'' infection,"" he added.,Lewin said understanding how the virus achieved this should speed up the development of new and more potent treatments for HIV, keeping its latency in check while also targeting its more active presence in the body.,The research is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Science this week.

,

,

,
,
,

,
A recent study has found that HIV's ancestor that infect monkeys is thousand of years older than previously thought which implies that HIV is not likely to stop killing humans anytime soon. ,The University of Arizona and Tulane University researchers stated that simian immunodeficiency virus, unlike HIV, does not cause AIDS in most of its primate hosts. ,If it took thousands of years for SIV to evolve into a primarily non-lethal state, it would likely take a very long time for HIV to naturally follow the same trajectory. ,The simian immunodeficiency virus, or SIV, is at least 32,000 to 75,000 years old, and likely much older, according to a genetic analysis of unique SIV strains found in monkeys on Bioko Island, a former peninsula. ,""HIV is the odd man out because, by and large, all the other species of immunodeficiency viruses impose a much lower mortality on their host species,"" said Michael Worobey of Tulane University. ,""So, if SIV entered the picture relatively recently as was previously thought, we would think it achieved a much lower virulence over a short timescale,"" said Worobey., ""But our findings suggest the opposite. If HIV is going to evolve to lower virulence, it is unlikely to happen anytime soon,"" he said. ,The study also raises a question about the origin of HIV, which scientists believe evolved from SIV. ,""Something happened in the 20th century to change this relatively benign monkey virus into something that was much more potent and could start the epidemic,"" said Marx. ,""We now have this little island that is revealing clues about SIV, and it says, ''It''s old.'' Now we know that humans were almost certainly exposed to SIV for a long time, probably hundreds of thousands of years,"" said Worobey. ,Marx tested his theory that SIV had ancient origins by seeking out DNA samples from monkey populations that had been isolated for thousands of years. His research team collected bush meat samples from Bioko Drills (Mandrillus leucophaeus). ,The scientists found four different strains of SIV that were highly genetically divergent from those found on the mainland. ,Worobey then compared DNA sequences of the viruses with the assumption that the island strains evolved in isolation for more than 10,000 years. ,The computer modelling showed the rate of mutation to be much slower than previously thought, indicating that the virus is between 32,000 and 75,000 years old. These dates set a new minimum age for SIV, although it is likely to be even older, said Marx. , The findings appeared in the journal Science.

If living with HIV is a daily struggle against anxiety and fatigue, scientists at National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) are looking to alleviate some of their miseries by exposing them to the Art of Living's Sudarshan Kriya (breathing exercise). ,A year-long scientific study has been planned, in which those living with HIV (who are not on medication yet) will be taught the breathing techniques and assessed to find whether their quality of life has improved. Says Dr Nita Mawar, principal investigator of the study that has been approved by the scientific research and ethical committees, ""The pilot study will initially involve 60 persons living with HIV. "" ,Mawar says depression is twice as common with people living with HIV as it is with the general population, which is compounded by stress and a sense of isolation from the community. ""While breathing techniques are known to help improve the quality of life for those suffering from high blood pressure, diabetes and asthma, we decided to scientifically study whether it can help people living with HIV as well."" ,The breathing exercise is the cornerstone of the Art of Living programme. ""We want to experiment whether this simple technique that utilises specific rhythms of the breath can increase their energy and stamina, enhance their immunity and help improve their physical and mental health."" ,The NARI scientists and trained tutors of the Art of Living Course from Vishwa Vikas Mahavidyapeeth will provide a 20-hour module, teaching those living with HIV both short and long kriya (breathing techniques), every week. ,NARI director Dr Ramesh Paranjape said the training would be conducted at the institute itself as there were issues pertaining to confidentiality of those living with HIV. ,""We will maintain a record of their sickness during the entire study period and assess them on the World Health Organisation's scale to evaluate their quality of life,"" says Mawar. ""Initially, those who do not require medication for treating the virus will be involved in the study. They will be asked questions such as did the breathing exercise help them to such an extent that they did not have to take medicines for headaches, or did they develop enough confidence to interact with people in the community.""

A battery of tests and several checks later, a trained technician at Pune's National AIDS Research Institute can wipe the sweat from his brow and positively say either a yes or a no to a person's HIV status. In the job for several years now, NARI is not only recognised as the country's apex lab but has only recently received recognition from the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration of Laboratories (NABL) this year. ,The HIV serological laboratory works overtime to ensure that there are no mistakes, says Dr Ramesh Paranjape, Director, NARI. So much so that now any HIV testing kit that National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) wants to purchase or a company wants to sell will have to be screened and evaluated by a consortium of five laboratories including NARI. ""In the last two months we have examined and tested as many as 35 HIV testing kits for their sensitivity and specificity,"" says Arun Risbud, a scientist at NARI. ,The consortium of five laboratories has been developed with an aim to create parity between the four national reference laboratories including NIMHANS at Bangalore, NICED at Kolkata, NCDC and National Institute of Biologicals at New Delhi. NARI, along with the other labs, will conduct the evaluation and batch testing of diagnostic kits for various transfusion transmitted infection (TTIs). ,""So far we have been depending on the World Health Organisation on quality control measures for evaluating test kits. We did not have our own mechanism to do so,"" says Paranjape. There have been reports in the past of faulty and substandard HIV test kits and this consortium has been developed to tackle such problems at the peripheral areas. ,As part of the model quality control programme, an inter lab comparison of the results is done in the first week of each quarter as an additional check to assure quality. Once in the laboratory the disease is detected either by the presence of antibodies to the virus or by the detection of the virus—its DNA and RNA. Three to five ml of the blood is collected in a clean screw-capped vial for the Enzyme- Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) test. When a serum sample tests positive to an ELISA, it is immediately repeated by a different system to confirm the diagnosis. ,Results are assessed and compared with standard results, a performance score is developed and feedback is given to the participating laboratories. Nearly 100 samples are tested and evaluated at NARI every day. NARI has also started Early Infant Diagnosis test using the dried blood spot-PCR method.

Patients suffering from AIDS in South Africa are unable to get right quantities of their lifesaving drugs so that they can be mixed with marijuana and smoked, say authorities and health experts.,The mixture is called ''whoonga''.,Whoonga smokers may be fooling themselves into believing the AIDS drugs are giving them a high, when it's really some other ingredient, said Njabulo Mabaso, an AIDS expert.,Some drug dealers are suspected of stretching the whoonga mixture with soap powder and even rat poison to increase their profits.,""We are seeing the use of whoonga in communities and its very widespread. It's a substance that is openly spoken about in communities,"" the Daily Mail quoted Lihle Dlamini of the Treatment Action Campaign, as saying.,Thamsanqa Langa of Durban said he didn't know what whoonga was when dealers first started offering the cream-coloured powder at about three dollars a smoke.,But after a few days he started having powerful headaches, stomach pains and night sweats. When he went back to dealers, ""They said, ''You need to smoke more, keep on smoking,"" recalled Langa.,Vincent Ndunge, a police spokesman in KwaZulu-Natal, said whoonga was first noticed two or three years ago when officers found gangs were robbing people of medication as they left hospitals.,Initially users crushed the pills and smoked them straight, but added other substances later, said Ndunge.

India has made remarkable progress in combating HIV/AIDS over the last ten years by reducing the overall exposure to this killer disease by 50 per cent, says a global report issued by a UN agency on the epidemic.,Besides, the Indian drug companies played a vital role in supplying the first-line drugs for HIV/AIDS patients in poorest African countries at phenomenally cheap prices, the UNAIDS said in its report.,""India reduced HIV/AIDS by 50 per cent while its pharmaceutical companies played a major role in care and treatment by supplying 86 per cent of the first line drugs to the poorest countries,"" said Mr Michel Sidibe, UNAIDS' executive director.,Around 2.4 million estimated people are living with HIV last year In India as against 2.5 million in 2001.,The UNAIDS' latest report suggested that around 33.3 million people were estimated to be living with HIV.,""We are breaking the trajectory of the AIDS epidemic with bold actions and smart choices,"" said Sidibe, cautioning that the disease will stage a comeback if adequate funding is not made possible by both international donors and domestic spending by the developing countries.,Over the last eight years, the rate of new HIV infections stabilised or decreased by more than 25 per cent in at least 56 countries around the world, especially in the poorest African countries.,Sub-Saharan Africa continues to be the region most affected by the epidemic with 69 per cent of all new HIV infections.,While there have been significant improvements in treatment which increased by seven and half times over the last five years with 5.2 million people accessing live-saving drugs in 2009, around 10 million people are still with without treatment.,In India, over 600,000 HIV patients are without treatment. He praised the Vatican for giving the green signal,for the use of condoms which was treated as a religious taboo,until recently.,""The Pope's latest announcement on condoms will have significant impact on HIV-prevention,"" he argued.,The Eastern Europe and Central Asia, including Russia, have become the epicentres for the spread of HIV/AIDS in the recent years.,In Asia, including India, the spread of HIV/AIDS is concentrated in some mega cities because of large scale migration of poor people in search of employment and their exposure to sex workers.

She also addressed a crowd of more than 600 who came to see her.,A day after her visit, government officials told patients they would have to leave by next week or face legal action because the center's permit was not being renewed, said Phyu Phyu Thin, a pro-democracy activist who founded the operation. By law, home owners must seek government permission every two weeks to allow visitors to stay overnight.,""We have been allowed to renew our resident permits in the past. I think authorities want to pressure us because of aunty's (Suu Kyi's) visit to the shelter,"" said Zeyar, a member of Suu Kyi's officially disbanded political party and one of the organisers of the shelter. The shelter, which includes a small wooden house and a two-story building of wood and thatch walls, currently accommodates 82 patients including young children, offering them housing, food, medicine and educational opportunities. Zeyar said health authorities offered Saturday to move the patients to their own HIV center. ""The patients have the right to make their own choice. The pressure by local authorities has made our patients very sad, which will adversely affect their health,"" he said. Some patients were defiant.

The patient purchased the medicines from the hospital pharmacy, but the bill does not mention the total cost,"" said Rachna Naik, an insurance officer with Population Services International (PSI) in Mumbai, a non-governmental organisation supporting the policy holders with their annual premium of Rs 1,511. ,PSI representatives say these delays can be largely attributed to faulty medical information in the hospital records. According to Ravi Subbaiah, incharge of this project for PSI, ""Inadequate proof of treatment in prescriptions largely leads to these problems. Insurance companies send back claims demanding confirmations, and policy holders have to run after doctors for additional written clarifications to get their due benefits."" ,When contacted, authorities at these two hospitals said details could not be shared without producing medical records of the patients. Experts say delays also happen due to a lack of understanding of the finer details of the policy among beneficiaries. ""One of the important exclusions of the policy is pre existing diseases, which is true for most medical insurances,"" said Subbaiah. ,However, he says the organisation which is responsible for scrutinizing applications based on eligibility criteria, receives applications for claims on problems like hypertension. ""The capacity building programme for HIV positive people that has started at Karnataka, needs to be replicated here. Patients have to be equipped in two areas — firstly, to demand proper treatment records from hospitals, and secondly to understand where they can avail of this scheme, and the conditions where it is not applicable,""added Dr Shekhar Waikar, the Mumbai in charge of PSI.,Experts also say that adding more hospitals to the cashless scheme will solve this problem. ""Currently hospitals are classified into two categories- network and non network ones. Cashless benefits can be availed only in network hospitals,"" said Dr Waikar. Though 187 hospitals are on the list of network hospitals in Mumbai-Thane, only a single patient has applied for benefits under the scheme from Bhiwandi, since May, as per PSI records. ,""We need to spread more awareness, and also see if these hospitals are accessible enough,"" said Rachna Naik. These hospitals are evaluated and added to the list by insurance companies. The scheme introduced in April in the city, is available for HIV patients with a CD4 count of 300, and clients are eligible for a benefit of up to Rs 30,000.,The policy was running in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and ten districts of Maharashtra, before being introduced in Mumbai. For a cover of Rs 30,000, the claimant has to pay a premium of Rs 1,511 to the insurance company, of which Rs 750 has to be paid by the policy holder and the rest is contributed by PSI. Half of this amount can be claimed at the onset of AIDS, and the other half for treatment of other problems, like co-infections associated with HIV.

Three leading laboratories, operating near the Dr Rajendra Prasad Medical College in Tanda, were sealed for conducting HIV tests illegally. ,Dr Rajendra Prasad Medical College, Dr Anil Chauhan, had written to the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) of Kangra, Dr Kultar Dogra, reporting the alleged illegal activities following which the laboratories were raided. The matter came to light last week following the death of a newborn baby in the hospital whose mother was reportedly tested positive by one of the three labs located outside the main entrance of the college.,The college lab, which had conducted subsequent tests on the mother, however declared her HIV negative. This had raised serious doubts on the tests done by the private lab  which charge exorbitantly from poor patients. The family members of the woman who delivered the baby had filed a complaint with the Principal of the college. The baby died within 24 hours of delivery.,Dr Chauhan said, ""It's strange that our doctors rely on the private laboratories rather than the hospitals. They could have verified the test reports. This practice is not permitted under the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO). We have initiatives the action."",He also expressed surprise about the tests being conducted without obtaining approval of the state's AIDS Control Society. ""Labs conducting such tests in the district or elsewhere are liable for criminal offense. I have sent a complaint to the police for registration of cases against the three labs Amol Lab, Nandan Lab and Naseem Lab,"" he said.,Records of the three laboratories have been seized.,Dr Sulakshana Puri, project director of the state AIDS Control Society said, ""HIV tests are conducted only in government owned centres, which follow strict norms and have councellors. There are 48 such centres in the state. We have not allowed any private lab to conduct these tests,"" she said.

Six months after the first-ever medical group insurance policy for the HIV positive in Mumbai-Thane region was introduced, beneficiaries have started complaining of delay in reimbursements. The scheme, introduced in April for HIV patients in Mumbai-Thane, is supported by United States Agency for International Development (USAID).,A patient who sought treatment at a nursing home in Kurla (West) had a harrowing experience when he was discharged without proper records of his admission in July. A representative of Mumbai Network of Positive People, who was closely associated with the claimant, said the hospital discharged him without discharge certifications. He was only given OPD papers.

At a time when neglect and social ostracism for HIV-positive people are rife, a village in Uttar Pradesh has rallied around an HIV-positive  woman. Praveen Devi (30), a resident of Tuksan village in Hathras, has been elected to the local block development committee so she can battle a private hospital in Aligarh, where she allegedly contracted the infection through a blood transfusion.,The people voted for her even though she never came out for canvassing. ""We never cared what she will do for the village, we just wanted her to win the election to fight her own battle,"" said Dinesh Chowdhary, a villager. ,""We hoped that after winning, she may get support to fight her case. No one listens to the common man,"" said Mukesh Kumar, the pradhan of Tuksan. ,Before Praveen was declared elected on October 31, the Health Department authorities did not listen to her. Now things have started moving, with the intervention of state Power minister Ramveer Upadhyay. ""I have asked the Aligarh Commissioner to look into the matter,"" said Upadhyay. Aligarh's Chief Medical Officer Dr Uma Kant Gupta has formed a three-member committee to probe the issue.,According to Dharamveer Singh, Praveen's uncle, she got the virus when she was admitted to a private hospital in Aligarh seven months ago. In the final stages of pregnancy, she suffered blood loss and was administered two bottles of blood. A few days later, she was discharged. But when her health showed no improvement, she was taken to a Agra hospital. A blood test showed that she was HIV-positive. A laboratory in Mumbai confirmed the result. ,In June, after she was discharged from the hospital, the family went to the Aligarh hospital. ""The doctors said they needed the original papers, which mentioned she had been administered two bottles of blood,"" said Umesh, her husband. ""We gave them the paper, but they did not return them."" On the next visit, the doctors denied that she had ever been administered blood.  Umesh wrote to the Health department, but there was no response. ""Then we asked villagers to help us,"" he said. They decided to field her for membership of the block development committee, which comprises three villages. The villagers then approached the other two villages for support. Umesh says their two elder children were born through ceasarian section, but except his wife, no one in the family — he or their three children, Mayank (5), Shagun (3) and Kajal (seven months) — have tested positive for HIV.

,
B J Medical College (BJMC) has been selected the only trial site in India for a study on cutting mother-to-child transmission of HIV, and will enroll around 100 mother-infant pairs for the study that promises to find the best drug regimen.,Dr Nishi Suryavanshi, clinical research site study coordinator, said the 'Promoting Maternal-Infant Survival Everywhere' (PROMISE) study would enroll HIV infected women who do not qualify for anti-retroviral treatment (their CD4 T cell count, a measure of immune health, exceeds 350).,Dr PW Sambrey, head, Gynaecology and Dr Aarti Kinikar, head, paediatrics at BJMC, are principal investigators of the trial which will also be conducted at sites in Africa.,Kinikar said the objective was to study the effectiveness of different drug regimen. This is a largescale trial, to be undertaken in more than 7,000 HIV-infected women. ""We hope to begin trial once the Indian Council of Medical Research approves it,"" said Kinikar, who feels it's important as it may lay down national guidelines for prevention of mother-to-child transmission. ,The International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials network will conduct the study with funding from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, both part of the National Institutes of Health.,The first phase will examine which of the two proven strategies is safer and more effective for preventing mother-to-child transmission before and during delivery, giving HIV-infected pregnant women a three-antiretroviral-drug regimen beginning from 14 weeks of gestation, or giving them the antiretroviral drug zidovudine beginning from 14 weeks of pregnancy and a single dose of the antiretroviral drug nevirapine during labour. The regimen of zidovudine and nevirapine is the standard in many countries for women who do not yet require treatment for their HIV infection. ,The second phase will compare safety and efficacy of the two methods of preventing mother-to-child HIV transmission during breastfeeding. The study team will assign mother-infant pairs at random either to receive a daily dose of infant nevirapine or to put the mothers on a three-antiretroviral-drug regimen throughout the breastfeeding stage.

Studding in a leading private school, the eight-year-old threw a tantrum when his 11-year-old sister missed his birthday last year. Since then, his sister, who studies in an MCD school in East Delhi, reminds her foster mother a day in advance to ensure rakhi and birthdays are never forgotten. The siblings lost their parents to HIV AIDS seven years ago, and have been forced to live separately for the last five years — she is HIV-positive, he is not. ,Representatives of CHELSEA, the Shahdara-based NGO where the children were first brought, said no government or private orphanage accepted them together, despite repeated attempts. ,A pilot study to identify and assess the living conditions of such HIV-affected children has been flagged off in 10 districts of states across the country by the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) in partnership with NGOs which provide care to such children.,Explaining the objective of the study, titled the Children Affected By AIDS (CABA), NACO's antiretroviral therapy consultant Dr B B Rewari said, ""CABA is trying to analyse how many constitutionally guaranteed nutritional, educational, psycho-social and legal rights for children are actually being exercised by HIV-affected children. Under this, we are covering children infected by HIV, those with one or both parents living with HIV, and those who have lost one or both parents to the virus."" ,Researchers are also training anganwadi teachers, school authorities, doctors and nurses at primary healthcare centres on ways to handle HIV-affected children. ,In Delhi, the only state in the list that does not feature in the high-risk category, the Northeast region was selected due to its high HIV prevalence rate. UNICEF, Family Health International (FHI) and USAID are other agencies supporting this study. ,At CHELSEA, 733 such children have sought help this year, of which only 74 are HIV-positive. Dr A K Gupta, Assistant Project Director of the Delhi State AIDS Control Society, said, ""Most of these children are not infected with the virus, but are still denied institutional care at many orphanages the minute their parents' history is disclosed."" ,Newsline spoke to a few such children in Delhi. An eight-year-old who is positive, lives with his HIV-positive mother and his 12-year-old brother, who is negative. ""I take three medicines at 8 pm everyday. My mother takes her pills at 9 pm everyday. If we miss our medicines, we will die,"" he says matter-of-factly. His mother confesses she knew she was positive when he was conceived, but did not tell the doctors.The boy was told about his HIV status when he was six. ,""I know I may die soon, but I must not tell my friends about my illness,"" he says. ,Another HIV-positive five-year-old was accommodated at an organisation catering to such children by the same NGO two years ago. Her five siblings have not seen her since. The two eldest, aged 17 and 15, dropped out of school three years ago when their mother succumbed to the virus. Since then, they have been surviving on their sewing skills. ""She misses her sisters, she asks about them even now. But they cannot afford the bus fare to come to her,"" says Manju Manak, project coordinator at CHELSEA's Shahdara centre. In the Capital, Naz and and Deepa Foundations, the only two providing hostel facilities for such children, have a cap of 30 and 15 children respectively.

Upstairs in the Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centre at Safdarjung Hospital, a man narrated the horror of his life to the visitor from France. In that space, both stood on common ground. They were both fighting a disease — one through his suffering and hope, the other through her appeal, through her situation in life, of being the French First Lady.,That's where Carla Bruni, brand ambassador for Global Fund that raises awareness about HIV/AIDS, came face to face with the fight, and its reality in India. Besides the man, there was a woman — both are undergoing ART treatment at the hospital.,Bruni nodded, said they would be fine, that the woman's babies would be healthy.,Her visit spanned three rooms and 60 minutes of listening, watching and talking to patients, staff.,It all began on the first floor of the hospital, in the out patients department. Shortly after 11 am, doors leading in and out of the corridor shut, and pregnant women sat on plastic chairs outside Room No. 162, the gynaecology OPD.,Whoever was inside — the patients, and the staff — remained to contribute their part, to play their roles in the journey that Bruni undertook at the hospital to understand the antenatal care procedures which ensure infected mothers don't pass on the HIV/AIDS virus to their babies.,Safdarjung Hospital runs a programme for HIV-positive pregnant women and this is where Bruni came to spread the message of the Born HIV Free campaign she launched a couple of years ago. To her, it was also a personal moment — she lost her brother to the disease in 2006, and has been involved with raising awareness about the disease.,Inside the OPD, women lay on two steel beds, and two doctors attended to them. Bruni, surrounded by hospital officials and her own entourage, listened as they explained the process.,Her next stop was Room no. 157, the PPTCT centre, where she sat in a counseling room as counsellor Archana Kushwaha walked the 12 women and the First Lady through a presentation on ANC and HIV/AIDS. ,In India, HIV/AIDS testing for pregnant women is not mandatory but the hospital and National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) are running a programme at Safdarjung that has the largest number of child deliveries. In October this year, the number touched 17,833. ,For her visit, the patients hadn't been shooed away. Hospital officials let them be so she could see it as it were. ,On the fifth floor, she saw the patients, the ones infected with the disease. That's where she spoke to doctors, counsellors, and the patients.,In the centre, splashed with posters spreading hope and new life after AIDS, Bruni said all would be fine.,""Her visit is important because of her popularity and that can go a long way in raising awareness. She knows in detail about the disease. To her, it was recreating the journey of the women who come in, get counselled to be tested for HIV/ AIDS and finally, interacting with those who are living with it here,"" said Dr P Rajvanshi, Nodal Officer in charge of the ART Centre. ,From the hospital, Bruni went to the Naz Foundation, an NGO fighting for HIV positive and Gay rights. Inside the care home, 27 children, including 17 undergoing ART treatment, awaited her arrival. They had made a collage of their paintings, a gift they wanted her to keep as a token of their acknowledgment.,They sang for her, too. Phil Collins, ""You'll be in my heart ...""  And Bruni promised she would send them her next album due for release next year.

,

,

,
,


,
Plans to introduce a more accurate HIV-testing method at the blood banks of at least two leading Delhi government hospitals are stuck in limbo. Sources in the Delhi Health department confirmed that the Nucleic Acid Test (NAT) mechanism, approved as a replacement for the presently used Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) technology in January this year, has not made much of a progress. ,The project was announced through a Public Private Partnership (PPP) model at the Guru Teg Bahadur (GTB) and Lok Nayak Hospitals, with smaller blood banks of other government set-ups also attached to these nodal centres. ,The method brings down the window of HIV testing from about six weeks to eleven days. This is because while ELISA traces antibodies developed to the virus, the NAT detects the HIV antigen itself. ,According to Dr A K Gupta, additional project director at the Delhi State AIDS Control Society (DSACS), which first approached the government authorities with this idea, ""We had received complaints from some people living with HIV (PLHIVs) who claimed they got the virus after undergoing blood transfusion at government hospitals. While they had a history of being administered blood, there was no concrete way of determining whether the virus came from the donated blood. But it was a serious allegation."" Dr Gupta added that DSACS gathered data to convince the government that HIV rates could be brought down by 1-2 percent by introducing NAT, before the project was given the green signal. ,Under the PPP mode, private players would provide the consumables, equipment and the necessary staff to run the test on the hospital premises. According to Dr Bharat Singh, in charge of the State Blood Transfusion Council (SBTC), ""We are still working to finalise the companies and the rates they will charge us per test. We hope to complete the work in the next few months."" ,He added that no deadline has been set yet for these private players to actually start operations. ""Private companies will handle the operations entirely. It is up to them to start as fast as possible,"" said Dr Gupta. Sources added that the costs involved are responsible for the delay. ""A single NAT test costs around Rs 1,000 to Rs 2,000, when done on a mass scale. Private blood banks charge up to Rs 5,000 for this test. Working out a plausible plan to provide this test free of cost to government hospital patients is taking time,""said a senior official. ,Incidentally, the NAT test has been made operational at two central government hospitals in Delhi over the last two years. Where AIIMS pioneered the move in 2008, Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital followed suit last year. According to Dr Kavita Chatterjee, in charge of the regional transfusion centre at AIIMS, ""We trained our own staff and the equipment was sanctioned by the government. For the last two years, we have been doing both NAT and ELISA tests to be doubly sure, and the project has proved completely viable.""

Yes, I will,"" she told activists from the NAZ Foundation, an outfit fighting for HIV positive and Gay rights, who wanted her to raise with the European Commission (EC) their stand disallowing generic medicines from India to be exported to their nations for treating HIV positives.,NAZ Foundation's executive director Anjali Gopalan brought the issue to Bruni's notice and her concern over the EC stand was also voiced by Global Fund Executive Director Prof Michel Kazatchkine, who accompanied the French First Lady during the visits.,As part of her campaign for prevention of HIV/AIDS and promoting related programmes, she went around the capital's Safdarjung Hospital, which runs a programme for HIV positive pregnant women and appreciated the ""courage"" shown by the patients there in ensuring that their progenies are free of the debilitating virus.,""It is very courageous. She will have a healthy baby. She is very courageous to do that,"" Bruni told the hospital's doctors after interacting with a migrant labourer's wife from Uttarakhand, who was found to be HIV positive during her pre-natal tests.,The First Lady was taken around the wards, where the hospital provides services for preventing parent-to-child HIV transmission integrated with general patient care and maternal health, by National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) Joint Secretary Aradhana Johri and hospital medical superintendent Dr N K Mohanty.,The model-turned activist later told waiting reporters that the ""prevention of transmission of AIDS is one of the most important fights that humanity has to face. I am taking care, in particular, the prevention of transmission from mother to the child. Because, of course, AIDS does not concern the minority, but concerns everyone of us."" Referring to her interaction with the HIV positive pregnant women, she said, ""They can come here and I think it is a great achievement that the doctors and the nurses are doing here."" ""Because pregnant women can get tested here and often they accept the tests for their baby so they can be treated for being HIV positive and their baby will be born healthy."" On why it is important for her to take up this campaign, Bruni quipped, ""Isn't it evident?"" But, she stressed that ""it is important for babies to be born HIV-free."" ""Since we have the drugs that the Global Fund can bring to every country, my job is to talk about it and to say to every mother to go to the hospital, get tested and it is not a trauma, it is just a disease and it is not a malediction and your child will be healthy and you can take care of your family as well,"" she added.,At the NAZ Foundation, which had successfully contested the Section 377 of IPC in the Delhi High Court to get it declared illegal, Bruni took a good look at the facilities that the outfit was providing for 46 HIV positive children, who are inmates of the care home.,The First Lady was asked by one of the children at the care home what she thought of India. ""I love India. This time, I am here for only four days. But next time, I will be here for four weeks,"" she said.,The children sang songs, both in English and Hindi, for her and presented her and Kazatchkine with paintings that they had made specially for the occasion.,""You all look very happy, healthy, loved and educated,"" Bruni told them.,Asked to sing a song from her coming album, the First Lady said, it will come out in 2012 and that she would sing for them the next time she was there at their care home.,

,
There is good news for Himachal Pradesh as HIV-AIDS prevalence rate in the state has come down to 0.03 per cent, against the figure of 0.36 per cent recorded in 2007. Officials attribute it to the increased number of voluntary testing centres in the state, as a result of which as many as 2,07,360 people, including 77,104 pregnant women, turned up for tests. ,Out of the 4,829 HIV positive people — of them 1,145 are full-blown cases of AIDS — in the state, many have become part of active groups of People Living With AIDS (PLWA) and have scripted stories of resilience by asserting themselves in the society. In 2007, there were 1,930 HIV positive people, of which 397 were full-blown AIDS cases. ,Manu (name changed), 26, from Bilaspur district is one such person. She works as an aanganwadi worker in her village and had faced social boycott about four years ago after her husband died of AIDS. ,Talking to The Indian Express, Manu said: ""After losing my husband, I, too, tested positive for HIV, but my five-year-old son is safe. People stopped sending their children to the aanganwadi centre fearing their kids would also contract the disease from me. I took a firm stand and went to each house in the village and tried to educate everyone about AIDS. But when they did not agree, I told them I would register a police complaint. At this juncture, a few educated people intervened and helped my case. Today, everyone in the village supports me and has accepted me as one of them."" ,At a function organised in Shimla on World AIDS Day, Chief Minister Prem Kumar Dhumal said: ""The initiative of people living with AIDS in directly connecteding with the AIDS awareness campaign in Himachal as resource persons is encouraging. Other HIV positive patients should also come out openly and discuss about HIV-AIDS in the society to spread the correct message. Along with three main anti-retro viral  treatment centres at RPMC, Tanda, Shimla and Hamirpur, eight link centres in rest of the district have been started, too."" ,Referring to the recent case of wrong HIV test in Kangra, the CM issued directions to ensure right diagnosis. ,Many patients, including schoolchildren who lost their parents to AIDS, were in Shimla to attend the function. Ramneek (name changed), a Class IX student from Paonta Sahib, said: ""I am happy that I did not face any social stigma in my school or neighborhood. This gave me confidence to openly speak on AIDS awareness on various platforms and also for psychological counselling of other patients.""

AIDS patients in Pune, Nagpur and Aurangabad won't have to travel all the way to Mumbai's J J Hospital as second line drugs for HIV will be made available in the cities soon. ,At present, B J Medical College and Sassoon General Hospital's anti-retroviral treatment (ART) centres have a total of 6,423 patients. Of these, approximately 200 patients require second line drugs and 55 people shortlisted for the treatment have to go to Mumbai for the drugs, ART centre officials at Sassoon Hospital said.,However, Dr Dilip Deshmukh, additional director of Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS), said they are planning to set up facilities at Pune, Aurangabad and Nagpur for providing second line drugs.,In the state, a total of 88,420 HIV-infected people are taking ART from 52 centres. MSACS — which implements an HIV prevention care, support and treatment programme in the state — is implementing the third phase of the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP III), which calls for a decentralisation and subsequent strengthening of services at the district level. ,Deshmukh said this year, three new ART centres and 10 new link ART centres were opened in the districts.,According to Dr D B Kadam, in charge of the ART centre at B J Medical College, 22,321 people have been registered for their share of drugs, of which 6,423 are presently under treatment.,Of these, 3,126 are men, 2,720 are women, 341 are boys below 15 and 223 girls below 15 years.,At the Armed Forces Medical College, 1,028 HIV patients are on ART while 2,590 are on ART at the YCM Hospital.,In India, an estimated 23.9 lakh people were infected with HIV in 2009 at an estimated adult HIV prevalence of 0.31%. ,Adult HIV prevalence among men is 0.36%, while it is 0.25% among women.

,
,


,
While the rate of HIV prevalence is on the decline among pregnant women and female sex workers, experts say the high-risk group that is causing concern is that of men having sex with men (MSM).,A tentative survey found there are around 6,000 MSM in Pune. ,""So far, we have provided intervention in the form of condoms and other medical aid to 1,600 MSM in the city and surrounding areas,"" says Bindu Madhav Khire, coordinator of the Sampathik Trust.,She pointed out that on the World AIDS Day they want to appeal to as many men as possible to undergo HIV test.,Sampathik Trust, that is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation via the NGO Pathfinder, has received a grant of Rs 30 lakh this year to distribute around 20,000 condoms in Pune and around 12,000 condoms in Pimpri among the target group of MSM.,""We hire people from this group to find others like them and educate them to undergo HIV tests to prevent transmission,"" says Khire.,""Instead of organising events this year, we have decided to focus on a campaign that urges the MSM to undergo HIV tests. Of a registered 1,600 MSM this year, 300 have agreed for voluntary HIV testing,"" says Khire, adding that as part of the measures to prevent HIV transmission they have funded their visits to doctors for check-ups.,At times it is difficult to locate MSM as there are some migrant labourers who have wives at their native places but get attached to men during the course of their work. In urban areas, there are married men who are bisexual and the risk of HIV transmission is higher in this group, says Dr R S Paranjape, Director of NARI. He has undertaken a study with the Mumbai-based Humsafar Trust to study various aspects of HIV transmission among MSM.,The study is funded jointly by the Indian Council for Medical Research and the National Institutes of Health.,It is executed at the Humsafar Trust in collaboration with NARI and Fenway Community Health Center, Boston.,The study aims at understanding the social and sexual networks of MSM in Mumbai, says Priti Prabhugate, in charge of the research study at Humsafar Trust.,So far, Humsafar has found out in smaller studies that married MSM are at a higher risk of getting HIV. They typically lead a double life where they may be married to a woman but still have male partners. Here, they have lesser bargaining powers than unmarried MSM and are more stressed out than the unmarried MSM, Prabhugate added.

When visiting French President Nicolas Sarkozy discusses official issues with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in Delhi on December 6, his wife Carla Bruni will be busy with another mission — helping the fight against AIDS.,The French First Lady — goodwill ambassador of the Geneva-based Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria — will visit a Delhi hospital and an NGO-run home for HIV-positive children. ,Bruni's visits have been coordinated by the French Embassy and the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO).,On Monday morning, she will first visit Safdarjung Hospital, which has a NACO-run centre for testing and counselling, where she will interact with women and children as well as meet the staff.,Next, Bruni will head towards the Naz Foundation-run home for HIV-positive children in East of Kailash. ,Naz Foundation chief Anjali Gopalan confirmed that the home is on the French First Lady's itinerary. ""It's a great thing...will be wonderful for the kids. They are quite excited and are researching about France...they are learning about the Eiffel Tower,"" Gopalan said. There are about 30 children in the home. Bruni's endeavour towards the cause of the AIDS-affected comes from the fact that her brother, Virginio, died of the disease.,""Because of my brother, of course I am very sensitive to the issue of AIDS,"" the supermodel-turned singer had told Elle magazine in December 2008, when she took up the anti-AIDS cause.,Bruni had said preventing mother-to-child HIV transmission would be a priority and so, her visit to Safdarjung and the NGO-run home fits in with her goals.

India has asked all its missions not to insist on HIV testing of foreigners, especially foreign students, after it found out that Indian embassies and consulates abroad are  displaying ""mandatory testing"" on their visa forms and websites.,The circular has recently been issued by Joint Secretary (passport and visa division) in the Ministry of External Affairs to all Indian envoys across the world. ,Indian missions in the US, UK, Australia, Russia, Canada and the Netherlands are among the defaulters found to have displayed the requirement, despite a Home Ministry decision to discontinue with the HIV testing procedure a few years ago.,Sources said attention was drawn to the MEA by various civil society groups, including the Forum of Parliamentarians on HIV and AIDS (FPA), a voluntary outfit comprising MPs cutting across all major political parties.,The activists hailed the MEA circular to all missions as, according to them, it puts India on a par with the US and China that have recently lifted their travel restrictions.,According to FPA activists, the move was prompted by a parliamentary question in April 2010 by Congress MP in Rajya Sabha E M Sudarsana Natchiappan, who is also state organiser of the FPA.,In a statement issued through UNAIDS, Rajya Sabha MP Oscar Fernandes, who is also the FPA president, said: ""I am pleased that India has clarified its position to lift HIV-related travel restrictions."" ,UNAIDS country coordinator Charles Gilks said, ""Such regulations were issued by many countries in the 1980s when little was known about HIV, and there was more of confusion and fear about the virus. Globally there is no evidence that such restrictions prevent HIV transmission or protect public health. The MEA move upholds India's commitment to human rights and dignity of all people, including those who are living with HIV.""

Deputy Commissioner, Child Development, Maharashtra, Harish Rathod on Monday said the focus of the proposed integrated children protection scheme will be on children living with HIV and those who had mental retardation. ,Rathod interacted with several children and NGOs at a function organised ahead of World AIDS Day (December 1). The Network of People living with HIV in Maharashtra, Plan India, MAMTA, Delhi organised a get together on Monday where children from 15 districts participated. ,Rathod agreed to look into issues raised by the NGOs regarding delay in implementation of welfare schemes due to paper work. Salim Shaikh from the NMP + raised the issue that most children did not have the necessary documents and it took years to prove that they were orphans. Suvarna Ghatge from the Network said lack of certificates often delayed granting of relief to orphans. The community members stressed the need for continuation of programmes that provide care and support services to children. According to a UNAIDS report, as many as 70,000 children below the age of 15 are living with HIV in India. As per the estimates of the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), 33,000 newborns contract HIV every year from positive mothers. Of this, over 50 per cent die within two years of birth while 80 per cent die within five years. In Maharashtra under the CHAHA project, NGOs along with Global Fund are providing care support packages to 19,388 children. Out of this, 3268 Children are living with HIV. ,Since July 2007, MAMTA, PLAN and NMP+ along with fifteen consortium partners are implementing the CHAHA project, a child-centered care & support programme for families and communities.

At the National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS) in Pune, the HIV research laboratory has been upgraded to biosafety level 2 and people have been warned against entering it. For the last four years now, research has been encouraging and for the first time, scientists, in association with the Punjab-based National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPER), have identified new lead molecules from plant abstracts, synthesised them and are conducting tests in cell culture to evaluate their role as microbicides in the fight against HIV. ,The discovery of the new lead molecules, which have shown strong anti-HIV activity, has led the scientists to file for patents. Dr I P Singh, Assistant Director of the Department of Natural Products at NIPER, agrees that it is a novel find and may help further research on HIV. ,In the last 25 years, HIV/AIDS has claimed 25 million lives worldwide. The HAART therapy currently in use comprises drugs that are either nucleoside or nucleotide, reverse transcriptase inhibitors or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor or protease inhibitors or supplemented with the addition of a fusion inhibitor. It  is able to control the viral replication but fails to eradicate the virus completely, said Debashis Mitra, a scientist from NCCS who was part of the study. ,Thousands of molecules are being researched worldwide but several get lost along the way. Scientists at NCCS and NIPER got together to tap natural products which are a rich source of biologically active compounds. The molecules that have been identified with anti-HIV activity have been modified, synthesised and different analogues have been prepared to improve their utility. ""At our laboratory the CD 4 cells are infected with the HIV virus and then molecules are added. This is incubated for three-to-seven days. We then assess whether the compounds helped reduce the virus. Now, being a good microbe, it has to inhibit the virus at the entry level. Hence, in-vitro tests in cell culture are planned with cervical epithelial cell lines followed by cervical epithelial explants. Here we can check whether the molecules can work as a potent microbicide and block HIV's transmission,"" explains Mitra. Coming ahead of World AIDS Day (December 1), these findings could contribute to solving the HIV puzzle.

,
Sperm wash is an option gaining ground among sero-discordant couples (where only one partner has HIV infection) who wish to have their own child. It takes multiple sperm washes, many counselling sessions and successful insemination to enable such couples to have their own uninfected baby. ,The IVF centre at Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital had helped at least 39 sero-discordant couples to get such children. Dr Mamta Dighe, programme director at the centre, says sperm-washing techniques had substantially changed the paradigm of fathering children in sero-discordant couples. ""The decision to have their own child can be stressful in sero-discordant relationships. There is the typical stress all couples feel when deciding to start a family, but there are additional concerns of HIV transmission to the negative partner and the unborn child."",Dighe says the hospital has been conducting the laboratory semen washes since 2006, wherein the seminal plasma is separated from the semen. The semen is then given multiple washes in a separate centrifugation machine. She points out that the couples are counselled that despite a sperm wash, there are chances of the child being infected with HIV. ""The risk of transmission is extremely low but we cannot say that it will not happen."",The hospital has a near complete success rate so far, barring one case and all the children born not having the virus.,Semen washes are periodically done at the Poona Fertility Centre, too. ""We get several queries from sero-discordant couples,"" says Dr Shehbaaz Daruwala, chief embryologist at the centre. ""Gynaecologists refer their patients to our centre and we counsel them before going ahead with the sperm-wash techniques. A specific media is used for washing the semen and removing the debris... It is a technically demanding process."",HIV consultant Dr Sanjay Pujari says people living with HIV are now living longer owing to the anti retroviral therapy. ,Dr S Khurd, former President of the Pune Obstetric and Gynaecologicial Society (POGS), says once the viral load in the plasma is not detectable (where the cutoff is 50 virus particles per ml of blood), the semen can be thoroughly washed. It may require more than once cycle for intra-uterine conception but clearly it is a method that has several takers. ,Pujari says couples require detailed information and lots of counselling on methods of conception and associated risks of transmission. ""The basic principle is to minimise the risk of transmission while improving the chance.""

Pune has something to cheer about this World AIDS Day (December 1) as a latest survey has revealed that there has been a dip in the prevalence of HIV infection among pregnant mothers in the city.,Till September this year a total of 149 out of 27,785 pregnant women who had registered for ante natal care at 42 Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs) were found positive with the infection. Dr B R Shende, District Programme Officer, AIDS said that there has been a dip in the prevalence of HIV infection among the high risk group of female sex workers as well.,According to Dr R S Paranjape, Director of National AIDS Research Institute (NARI), the national sentinnel surveillance has shown a dip in the HIV infection among the pregnant women. Giving a break up of the number of cases of HIV infection among pregnant women at ICTC centres, Shende said that in 2008 a total of 46,879 pregnant women were examined, of which 289 were infected, while in 2009 there were 55,219 pregnant women examined at the ICTC and 303 women were infected. The rate of HIV infection has dipped from 0.67 per cent in 2008 to 0.5 per cent in 2010, Shende added. ,Attributing this trend to general education and awareness among the people, Dr D B Kadam, in charge of the Anti retroviral treatment (ART) centre at Sassoon General Hospital told The Indian Express that the HIV epidemic had reached a plateau worldwide.,The state figure of the rate of HIV infection among ANC mothers has also dipped from 0.88 per cent in 2004 to 0.63 per cent in 2008.,In Pune, of 17,258 people with AIDS, 741 have succumbed from 1986 till now, says Dr M Nagara, district civil surgeon. Meanwhile, doctors said the life span of people living with HIV has increased in addition to their quality of life due to anti-retroviral treatment. ,A total of 22,321 people have registered for ART at Sassoon centre out of which 6,423 are on therapy. According to figures till October end, 341 boys and 223 girls below 15 are also on ART at Sassoon. At Armed Forces Medical College, 1,448 people have been registered for treatment out of which 1,028 are on ART while at YCM Hospital, Pimpri, 5,062 have been registered out of which 2,590 are on therapy.

Anubala, wife of Satish Chaudhary, underwent mental trauma after a test report of a private lab showed her HIV positive. Later Anubala underwent a Cesarean section in the emergency wing of RPMC Tanda on the basis of the private lab's faulty report. In 24 hours, they lost their new-born child. It was only after the operation and vasectomy, and the death of their child, that the government hospital tested the couple and found them both negative.

The couple claims that Praveen Devi acquired the infection after she was administered blood at the Aligarh hosptial where she was admitted for the delivery of her youngest child. The baby was born through cesarian section.,According to Dr Gupta, there was no record in the hospital which could establish that the woman was administered blood when she was admitted in the hospital.,Dr Gupta also said that Praveen Devi wasn't tested for HIV during her stay at hospital, so it can't be said with certainty that she did not have the infection at that time.,Umesh Chowdhary, however, insists that his wife was administered two units of blood at the hospital.

""In 2008, we admitted these children in Shiksha Kendra, which is a noon school for underprivileged children run by the DPS Society.They went to school for almost a month. After that, they said they don't want these children in their school,"" Gupta says.,But Rachna Pandit, principal of DPS Maruti Kunj, maintains the children were never admitted in the school. ""The NGO did approach us. But we never granted them admission. These children did come to the Shiksha Kendra for a few days but that was not formal admission,"" says Pandit. ,Pandit said teachers were apprehensive because they didn't know how to deal with these children.

Dengue and Chikungunya raised their ugly heads before the Commonwealth Games in the national capital triggering anxiety among participating countries who gave sleepless nights to the organisers by threatening to pull out.,A new superbug created scare when the New Delhi metallo-lactamase (NDM-1) that enables bacteria to be highly resistant to almost all antibiotics was found in British patients who travelled to India for elective surgery.,India was quick to question the naming of the bug after New Delhi. The Health Ministry responded to the issue with a tone of agitation and accused British scholars as scaremongers. A Chennai-based scientist, who was part of the research, claimed certain portions of his study were analysed differently.,With the city government unable to contain vector-borne diseases like dengue, chikungunya and malaria, leading a spurt in the number of casualties, Delhi virtually turned into the country's the disease capital.,As the pull-out chorus gained momentum, the government launched massive cleaning up operations in the capital. It, however, stuck to its contention that the increased cases of dengue were due to wide-scale construction activities ahead of the Games and blamed participating nations for overreacting as dengue was prevalent in many East Asian countries as well.,The Centre decided to prepare an action plan within the next three-four months to tackle these diseases. Under the plan, the ministries of Health and Family Welfare and Science and Technology will work together to develop vaccines for these commonly-communicable diseases.,The country has so far reported over 15,535 cases of dengue, of which 96 were fatal. Chikungunya was mostly reported in the national capital, with over 30 cases.,The fight against swine flu, another disease which reached pandemic proportions in 2009, got a boost this year with an indigenous vaccine for the disease.,However, new and tough pictorial warnings for tobacco products continued. Giving in to the demand of the tobacco industry, the government decided to retain existing pictorial warnings on cigarette and bidi packets for another year. The decision taken at a meeting of the Cabinet came a week after tobacco majors like ITC and Godfrey Phillips India stopped production due to uncertainty.,The existing pictorial warnings -- a scorpion on bidi packs and a cancer-affected lung on cigarette packs -- were to be replaced by a cancer-affected mouth, from December one after a notification by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in May.,The country got a first in terms of healthcare of sports persons when the first sports injury centre was opened shortly before the Commonwealth Games at the Safdurjung hospital.,The year 2010 saw the government introducing the bivalent polio vaccine on a pilot basis in Bihar.,India had the lowest-ever polio transmission levels in the year, especially during the high transmission season. There has been a sharp decline in the number of polio cases reported this year - only 41 polio cases in the country as on 30.11.2010 compared to 633 polio cases in the corresponding period of 2009.,As per latest data made available by National AIDS Control Organisation, in India HIV estimates 2008-09 highlighted an overall reduction in adult HIV prevalence and HIV incidence (new infections).,Adult HIV prevalence at national level declined from 0.41 per cent in 2000 to 0.31 per cent in 2009. The estimated number of new annual HIV infections has declined by more than 50 per cent over the past decade.,The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs approved a proposal for upgrading the National Centre for Disease Control, Delhi at an estimated cost of Rs 382.41 crore.,The revised National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke was approved by the CCEA for a provision of Rs 1230.90 crore out of which Rs 731.52 crore is for cancer component.

The Chandigarh State AIDS Control Society (CSACS) claims to have taken several initiatives to support people living with HIVs and also ensured that the treatment can be accessed universally. ,Project Director, CSACS, Dr Vanita Gupta, said Early Infant Diagnosis (EID) of HIV among infants and young children had been rolled out in ART Centre, PGI. ,""Earlier, it was not possible to conclusively diagnose HIV in infants born to HIV+ mothers till the age of 18 months, as the test being carried out would detect the HIV antibody, which could also be maternal antibody transferred to the baby. With the DNA PCR, it will now be possible to detect HIV infection in the baby as early as six weeks old and thus if any intervention is required it may be carried out at an early stage,"" said Gupta. ,Also, the baseline tests, which were being carried out for all patients before initiation of treatment at the ART centre of PGI, are now being provided free of cost. ""Earlier, patients had to spend almost Rs 200 to 250 for certain baseline investigations, which many could not afford,"" said Gupta.

India has rejected a drug patent application of a US multi-national pharma company, Abbot Laboratories, paving way for easy access to an important life-saving medication for HIV patients across the globe.,The decision to reject the patent application on the important combination drug, Lopinavir/Ritonavir filed by Abbot Laboratories was given by the Indian patent office here during the weekend and it is a major victory to millions of HIV-positive patients around the globe, according to NGOs working with affected patients.,The Indian patent office has put a halt to the multi-national Abbott Laboratories patenting and said it was not an invention.,""India, the world's leading supplier of affordable medicines, can now supply this drug to patients across the globe who are desperately waiting for treatment.,This combination drug is considered to be the frontline of defense for HIV positive patients who have failed to stay healthy with the first round of medicines available currently,"" Tahir M Amin, Director of Initiative for Medicines, Access & Knowledge (I-MAK), one of those who initiated legal action against the US company said in a communication from New York.,""This ground-breaking victory for patients sets an important precedent to stop pharmaceutical companies from gaming the patent system, marking a new era of hope for millions of HIV people across the world,"" Amin said.,I-MAK was one of the opponents from US and others were Indian pharma companies like Cipla (Mumbai), Matrix Laboratories (Secunderabad) and Okasa Pharmaceuticals (Mumbai).,This particular drug is critical to HIV patients who are failing first line treatment. However, not only has Abbott (the applicant for the patent) refused to license the drug, it is also refusing to match the lowest generic price when it comes to selling in countries like India, Brazil and China.,Abbott is also practising patent abuse as its has filed a number of applications in India covering various forms of the two drugs--Lopinavir and Ritonavir.,By doing so they are attempting to extend their monopoly for as long as possible under the guise of innovation and to keep at bay competition from Indian companies. Many of the patent applications cover the same technology with little modifications (in some cases none at all), but no therapeutic enhancement, Amin said.,The impact of the case is tremendous. There are over 33 million people living with HIV today and of these nearly 15 million require access to HIV drugs, he said.,Cost-savings generated over a three-year period by introducing generic Lopinavir/Ritonavir to 43 low and middle-income countries would be sufficient to start 1,30,000 new patients on HIV treatment who currently lack access. That is 1,30,000 lives that could be saved from opening up the market for this drug alone.,Cheaper generic versions of this drug are ready to reach patients in India and across the world. Most recently, the Clinton Health Access Initiative has negotiated a price of USD 440 per patient, per year for generic versions of this drug from four suppliers, he said.,Enabling competition amongst Indian suppliers has been demonstrated to consistently drive down prices on HIV medicines, from USD 10,000 per patient per year in 2000, to as little as USD 79 on Monday. ,This affordable pricing by generic suppliers in India is in stark contrast to the unaffordable pricing by Abbott Laboratories on HIV drugs across the world over the last decade.,Abbott's track record on pricing this drug unfairly for poorer countries motivated us to take on this case, Amin stated in a release.,""They have gamed the patent system for nearly twenty years to extend the patent life on this drug. The time has come to say, 'enough is enough',"" he added.,I-MAK reports that Abbott Laboratories holds at least 75 patents on Lopinavir/Ritonavir alone. The rejection of this patent application in India was for a combination of existing drugs and techniques.,I-MAK, a non-profit organisation, is a team of lawyers and scientists increasing access to affordable medicines by making sure the patent system works.,""We work globally to ensure that patents do not act as a barrier to research and restrict the public access to affordable medicines,"" Amin said.,Earlier, I-MAK has supported patient groups in India in filing against the Lopinavir and Ritonavir patents individually, as well as against the known soft-gel capsule of this drug combination. I-MAK has also challenged Abbott's patent in Europe.

India is set to have the first, government-run policy to provide health and life insurance covers for People Living with HIV (PLHIV). ,Sources in the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) confirmed that a meeting had been finalised between key stakeholders, including insurance companies, economists and international and national healthcare experts, to work out a sustainable model for the policy.,The meeting, scheduled for February 3 and 4, will see delegates of various countries where successful insurance policies have been implemented for PLHIVs. The aim is for experts to study the models of these countries to arrive at a structure suitable for India.,According to a senior NACO official, though providing insurance cover to PLHIVs was outlined as an important agenda in the ongoing National AIDS Control Programme-3, cohesive action was being taken only now. ,""Representatives from South Africa, the US, the Philippines and Namibia have confirmed their participation. The conference will also see a strong representation from the insurance sector. Officials from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority will also be present,"" the official said.,The government is seeking the help of NGO Population Services International (PSI), which has implemented a micro-level insurance programme for HIV-affected persons in high-risk states such as Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and some districts of Maharashtra.,According to Ravi Subbaiah, PSI project in-charge, ""Our existing programme only provides for a cover up to Rs 30,000 for patients with CD 4 count up to 300 (CD4 cells or T-helper cells are a type of white blood cells that fight infection and their count indicates the stage of HIV or AIDS in a patient). We are now looking at a pan-Indian project for a much greater premium, with importance on accessibility of services to patients."" ,He added that where the PSI programme only provides health insurance, brainstorming sessions with NACO had focused on a complete life insurance cover.,The PSI's existing initiative 'Connect' is supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and provides patients cashless facilities at hospitals enlisted in the network.,For a premium of Rs 1,511, the patient has to pay Rs 750, and the rest is subsidised by the PSI. Patients can avail of Rs 15,000 on hospitalisation at the onset of AIDS, and the other half for treatment of co-infections associated with AIDS.

The state government will launch Pokar — a statewide HIV/AIDS awareness campaign on Wednesday which will cover all the 26 districts by March 31. During the campaign period, it will cover 2,250 villages through 10 vehicles, covering three villages a day.,State Health Minister Jay Narayan Vyas told reporters on Tuesday that HIV victims will accompany each of the teams in these vehicles and narrate to the village audience their experiences, besides administering people a pledge not to indulge in unsafe sex practices and promiscuous behaviour. ,The 75-day campaign will encompass more than two million people, he said.,Vyas said only 0.38 per cent of total population in the state is affected by HIV/AIDS and the remaining 99.62 per cent that is unaffected, has to be made aware of the dangers. He said growing industrialisation and reverse process of infection (infected people returning to native places) is some of main reasons for the spread of HIV/AIDS.,The campaign will cost Rs 1.25 crore and is well organised and pre-planned and aims at being largest such effort in the world, he said. As a special measure for taking care of orphans, whose parents have died of AIDS, the state government has set up orphanages at Surat and Gandhinagar. The centres also facilitate children of HIV/AIDS inflicted parents special leave in schools, he said.,The government has also set up facilities for checking HIV/AIDS in the window period at Ahmedabad Civil Hospital blood bank which will be over and above the 800 testing centres now working in the state where half a million people were tested so far, he said.

The Delhi government has started a first-of-its-kind initiative to train healthcare professionals in government hospitals on accidental exposure to HIV while treating patients, or Post Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP).,""The government is generally accused of taking reactive steps. But this is a pro-active measure we decided to initiate, for generating awareness about the protocol to be followed in case doctors or paramedics are accidentally exposed to HIV in the course of their duty,"" said Faizi O Hashmi, project director of the Delhi State AIDS Control Society (DSACS). ,As part of the effort, a toll-free 24X7 PEP helpline — 1097 — has been opened (option 6). ""It is a one-point line that health officials can consult for any doubts,"" said Dr A K Gupta, additional project director of DSACS. ,Recently, a special training session for doctors and paramedics was held to explain the nuances of exposure situations. The DSACS has also authorised the distribution of the drugs prescribed by the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) as per the treatment protocol of PEP to all MCD and government hospitals. ,""So far, PEP medication was only available at the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres, but in order to save time in emergency situations we felt it was ideal if the medicines were made available at all hospitals,"" said Dr Gupta.,According to experts, all emergency medicine providers — labour and delivery room personnel, surgeons and OT staff, lab technicians, dentists, mortuary staff and waste handlers — are at possible risk for accidental exposure. ""At the training session, we tried to generate awareness about precautions to be taken for needle and stick use and disposal,"" said Dr Gupta. ,The Delhi government has also initiated a centralised notifying mechanism in case of accidental exposure. ,""We have now made it mandatory for hospitals to report staff members complaining of exposure, and their PEP treatment, to DSACS to facilitate a proper registry of accidental exposures,"" added Dr Gupta. ,Though limited studies have been initiated on this hazard, according to a survey conducted at the Safdarjung Hospital in March last year, among 428 healthcare workers, 343 gave a history of needle injuries, and only 40 per cent of the sample knew about the availability of PEP services. ,Under the NACO, PEP guidelines outline a protocol for immediate first-aid, counselling and risk assessment of exposed healthcare workers before starting treatment between 2 to 72 hours of exposure. As per the seriousness of exposure, drugs are prescribed for a four-week period, followed by lab investigations and a check-up.,* Percutaneous needle injuries,* Accidental contact with the mucus membrane of eye or mouth,* Contact with non-intact skin,* Exposure to body fluids of infected patient ,: Superficial wounds with a low caliber needle,: Injuries penetrating gloves,: Visible percutaneous injuries with a high-caliber needle visibly contaminated with blood, or accident with a used needle

A rohini court handed down life imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 on a man for murdering his friend over two years ago. Additional Sessions Judge Kamini Lau refused to admit the plea of public prosecutor Taufiq Ahmed, who sought capital punishment for the convict on the ground that he committed the crime after a drunken brawl over a minor issue. ,The convict used to work with the MCD on a contract basis. While awarding life imprisonment, the court took into account several mitigating factors, such as the fact that man was HIV-positive and committed the crime in the heat of the moment. ,The convict had a quarrel with his friend Ravi Kumar on December 19, 2008, at Ashok Vihar, when the victim, Rajbir, tried to intervene. The convict, who was inebriated, became annoyed and hit Rajbir on his neck and face with a broken liquor bottle, leading to his death. ,The court directed that the fine of Rs 50,000 should be paid to the victim's family as compensation.

He was transferred to Military Hospital in Binaguri. During treatment, he was given blood by four Armymen, one of whom was HIV-positive.  Later, Kumar was found to be HIV-positive, as submitted in the petition.,A court of inquiry found that standard operating procedure was not obeyed in the case and the blood was not screened before transfusion.,Kumar was discharged on January 31, 1997 after 15 years and 287 days of service. He was part of Op Rakshak, participated in operations in Bhutan and served in Somalia for two years with the United Nations under the UNISON-II operation. ,Kumar died on March 31, 2000, at the age of 33 years.

,

,

,
,


,
Breakthroughs in HIV research have encouraged the scientific community into looking for clues that can eventually shape up into an AIDS vaccine. Scientists are optimistic about discovering potent antibodies against variants of the virus. ,""A joint project of the US and Thai governments is the first demonstration that a vaccine can indeed protect humans from HIV infection,"" says Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), who met government officials in India over a vaccine discovery programme.,""This does not mean that the vaccine is ready in the market but a two-step regimen of two different AIDS vaccine candidates showed 30 per cent protection from HIV. Of course, this is not enough to satisfy public health authorities but now there is a renewed interest in testing modified experimental AIDS vaccines,"" says Berkley.,""What we are looking at now is at newer approaches: to design a vaccine that can harness an anitbody response. The HIV virus is a complex one. Each time the body decides how to neutralise the HIV, the virus simply changes its structure to evade an antibody response,"" Berkley says.,The recent discovery of a subset of antibodies (known as broadly neutralising antibodies) capable of preventing a wide range of HIV variants from infecting the cells has raised hope.,""Now we place greater emphasis on applied science for the rational design of conceptually novel AIDS vaccine candidates,"" says Dr Rajat Goyal, director of IAVI's India operations. ,Indian and US scientists are working together in the Indian Medicinal Chemistry Programme initiated in 2007 as a partnership between IAVI and several Indian institutions. The programme complements the work of IAVI's Neutralising Antibody Consortium.,Professor Raghavan Varadarajan of the Indian Institute of Science (IISC) says: ""We work on the designing molecules, analysing their protein structure, testing it in animals so that eventually it can be part of the vaccine."",Dr Virender Chauhan of  the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biology, principal investigator in the programme, says: ""When the virus was isolated we were hopeful there was one large protein on the surface and if a vaccine could be based on this, it would be a fairly simple exercise."" However the antibodies produced did not neutralise the virus. The subsequent Merck Step trial in the West looked promising as the vaccine had elicited a response in animals, but on humans it provided no protection.,In India, researchers have completed the Phase I prime-boost vaccine trial that had started in 2009. It was conducted on 32 volunteers, and the preliminary results showed that the vaccine is safe, its ability to elicit an immune response modest. ""The decision to take it into the second phase will be taken only on how strong the immune response is,"" says Dr R S Paranjape, director of the National AIDS Research Institute. ,""There is a lot of new information on HIV and the emphasis is also on designing new immunogens, the component that teaches the immune system to detect and target the pathogen,"" Paranjape says.,Berkley sums up, ""With recent discoveries, HIV vaccine researchers are gearing up for an exciting decade.""

Male circumcision can be a preventive tool against HIV and there is a need to explore its acceptability in India, experts have said.,Rate of HIV infections is coming down, but the development of a vaccine is still a remote prospect, so other preventive methods should be considered, says a research paper presented at a recently-concluded conference on HIV.,""As male circumcision has emerged as an effective HIV prevention option there is a need to explore its acceptability in India,"" the preliminary report prepared by researchers from Pune-based National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) says.,The group of researchers headed by Dr Seema Sahay also found, upon analysis of a study done by a task-force set up by Indian Council of Medical Research that people would find it hard to accept circumcision for the purpose of HIV prevention.,""Therefore, focus would be needed on developing the communication strategies around translating evidence into community-friendly messages on efficiency of male circumcision to prevent HIV among men,"" report says.,While doing this, cultural issues and traditional sensitivities should be taken into account, it adds.,The report was presented at the International Conference on 'Emerging Frontiers and challenges in HIV/AIDS Research'.,Male circumcision involves the surgical removal of the foreskin, which is a low-cost and permanent procedure.,An international study in 2005 found that it reduces risk of contracting HIV among men by 70 per cent.,The ICMR study was for understanding the views of the people (from both 'traditionally circumcising' and 'traditionally non-circumcising' communities) as well as that of the health-care providers, regarding male circumcision and other options, Sahay said.,The study showed that communities may accept circumcision as a hygienic practice but would still oppose it on religious grounds, she said.,But when asked if any study has been done to find out if incidence of HIV was low in the communities where circumcision is a common practise, she said, ""We have not conducted any religion-specific study."" NARI is currently conducting a study to gauge the response of various communities. The findings will be shared with the policy makers.,In 2005, a study by French and South African researchers showed that male circumcision reduced the risk of contracting HIV by 70 per cent -- a level of protection far higher than the 30 per cent risk-reduction which is the target of the AIDS vaccine.

Scientists have claimed that a pioneering treatment to thwart HIV, by genetically altering blood cells so the virus cannot invade them, has shown promise in the first nine infected people to receive it.,The treatment involves taking the white blood cells most prone to infection by HIV, called CD4+ cells, from someone with HIV, the 'New Scientist' reported.,These are then altered in the lab to sabotage a gene called CCR5, before being returned to the patient.,Because CCR5 makes the molecular ""door-handle"" by which HIV enters cells, treated cells become impossible for the virus to infect.,""This is the first example of genetic editing to introduce a disease-resistant gene in patients,"" said lead scientist Carl June at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.,Preliminary results presented this week at a virus conference in Boston reveal that a year after the treatment, the altered cells had increased in number.,In some patients, the cells had colonised areas of the gut and rectum mucosal linings where HIV multiplies, and where native CD4+ cells are usually depleted.

With an estimated 7,100 people getting infected with HIV every day and India home to 2.7 million HIV positive people, the government on Wednesday launched a new HIV vaccine design programme in the country. It was also announced that a new HIV Vaccine Laboratory will now come up in New Delhi. ,M K Bhan, Secretary, Department of Biotechnology, said that autonomous institute Translational Health Sciences and Technology Institute (THSTI) and the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) have agreed to jointly establish, operate and fund an HIV vaccine design programme in the country. ,The programme will primarily focus on one of the greatest scientific challenges of AIDS vaccine design and development: the elicitation of antibodies capable of neutralising a broad spectrum of circulating HIV variants — a problem that stems in large part from the almost unparalleled mutability of HIV. The programme will cost Rs 50 crore over five years. ,Dr Rajat Goyal, director, country and regional programmes, IAVI, told The Indian Express that Rs 19.3 crore will be spent by IAVI on the programme. This is one of the key partnerships with the government to share scientific knowledge that will boost translational research, Goyal said. ,THSTI director Dr Dinakar Salunke said there will be exchange of ideas in a mutually beneficial agreeement. A global search is underway to appoint scientists and directors. ""There will be three principal investigators and 15 scientists,"" Goyal added.

Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates has decided to stop funding programmes aimed at controlling HIV/AIDS. For nine-long years, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has funded HIV prevention programmes. And it is learnt that Union Health Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad had asked Gates to continue supporting the next phase of National AIDS Control Programme. However, Gates on Thursday made it clear that there will be no more large funding by the Foundation.,""The overall initiative has been a success. As far as the funding is concerned the large funding has already been done by us,"" he said, adding that most of the ongoing work will now be funded by the government. ,Launched in 2003, Avahan, an initiative to reduce the spread of HIV by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, began its work in India with a commitment of $200 million. This was increased to $258 million and then to $338 million in 2009. In 2009, the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) entered into a memorandum of understanding with Avahan — a reaffirmation of its commitment to HIV prevention as well as the beginning of transition of Avahan's projects to NACO and other partners. ,Even as the government was expecting more funding of $200 million for HIV interventions from the Foundation, Gates has decided to move ahead.  ""Lot of positive lessons have come from Avahan. Our Foundation is very committed. We want to initiate new inventions, new vaccines,"" he said.,According to officials in the health ministry, with AIDS figures declining, India can take ownership of the programmes and continue looking for donors. ,""It is a good thing that the Foundation is focussing on all major health problems in Bihar. They work in sync with the policies of the government and it will benefit the country in the long run,"" said K Sujatha Rao, former DG, NACO, and former health secretary.

New clinical trials have been launched in the US and Europe to test whether HIV virus can be ""flushed out"" through a new approach of using anti-retrovirals and immune modulating agents, revealed Prof. Christine Katlama, Head of the AIDS Clinical Research Unit, Department of Infectious Diseases, Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris.,Katlama, who is in Pune to participate in the first annual meeting of the HIV Medicine Association, was impressed by the quality of research in India and hopes to invite Indian doctors to participate in a clinical research course in June in Europe this year. ,The HIV Medicine Association's two-day meet begins on March 26 and will focus on educating physicians on aspects of HIV treatment, said Dr Sanjay Pujari, Director and Chief Consultant, Institute of Infectious Diseases. ,Katlama told The Indian Express that despite controlling the virus in the US and Europe, many new infections are reported. ""Can we eradicate the virus instead of just sustaining treatment...Can we lower levels enough to ensure a functional cure that can enable HIV positive people to safely stop antiretroviral therapy,"" said Katlama adding that the new trial launched in November last hoped to focus on a more potent strategy. ,""Antiretrovirals would be combined with immune modulating agents to 'flush out' the latent cell reservoir by triggering silent integrated proviral DNA to start producing new virus. This will then be susceptible to the potent antiretroviral drug combination,"" says Katlama, adding that 30 people have been enrolled in the clinical trial being conducted by biopharmaceutical company Cytheris. Participants will intensify their current suppressive regimen by adding the 2 newest antiretroviral drug classes, along with interleukin 7 (IL-7) to activate resting CD4 T-cells, she explained. ,Apart from Katlama , a host of experts will participate in the meeting, Pujari said. ,Dr Suniti Solomon, the founder-director of the YR Gaitonde Center for AIDS Research and Education Care, Chennai who was the first to discover an AIDS patient in India in the 80s will speak on 25 years of AIDS in the country at the meeting. Participants will also speak on challenges to antiretroviral therapy and the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.

,

,


,
,,Come May, and all blood banks in the city will have to carry out a more stringent HIV test for all donor blood samples. This is the first time an advanced testing mechanism to detect one of the HIV antigens will be introduced in the Capital.,The decision was taken at a meeting of blood bank officials from government hospitals and Red Cross Hospital, chaired by Health minister Dr A K Walia on April 18. ,Confirming this, Dr Walia told Newsline, ""It was important to introduce a more sensitive test that will take into account the window period of HIV. Starting May 15, all blood banks in the city have to compulsorily carry out an ELISA- 4 test on blood samples."" ,The 'window period' for HIV is an estimated six weeks that the body takes to produce antibodies to fight HIV. Since the prevalent testing method is only sensitive enough to detect antibodies, a donor may not test positive for HIV if he happens to be in this period after contracting the virus. ,The fourth generation technology will detect the P-24 antigen, which the body produces immediately after being infected by the virus. Procurement of the testing machines will be initiated at blood banks after official notices are issued by the Health minister in the coming week. Lok Nayak and Guru Teg Bahadur hospitals and any one blood bank deputed by the Red Cross Society will act as the nodal centres for this test. Smaller blood banks around these hospitals, who may not be able to procure the technology for the test, will have to send every sample to the closest nodal centre. ,The Delhi State AIDS Control Society (DSACS) had appealed to the Delhi government last year to consider a more advanced HIV-testing mechanism after receiving complaints from People Living with HIV, which stated that they had been infected with the virus after undergoing blood transfusion. Though DSACS had maintained there was no concrete way of determining the veracity of these allegations, these patients had had a history of blood transfusions. ,The State Blood Transfusion Council (SBTC) then started work on developing a private partnership project to introduce Nucleic acid-based tests (NAT) at Delhi government hospitals. The NAT, considered the most sensitive HIV test, detects other antigens associated with HIV besides P-24. It is only available at AIIMS and RML Hospital in the Capital at present. ,While this project is yet to see the light of day, Dr Walia maintained that it is in the pipeline. ,""We will introduce NAT testing in phases, since the costs involved are huge. But experts we consulted have told us the ELISA-4 technology provides comparable results,"" he added.

The residents of Shramik Referral Centre for People Living With HIV-AIDS are staring at an uncertain future as the Labour department, Delhi, has served the seven-year-old centre an eviction notice.,Abandoned by their families, around 27 patients of HIV-AIDS found home at the centre, run by activist Sreerupa Mitra Chaudhury in Giri Nagar, Kalkaji.  ,The centre was inaugurated by Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit in 2004, said Chaudhury.,The city's only Half-Way-Home for the HIV positive workers, however, can see hope in a recent Delhi High Court order, which did not lend credence to the unfavourable inspection report of the Deputy Labour Commissioner (South). Staying the execution of the eviction notice, Justice S Muralidhar also asked the government to take a fresh decision.,The Delhi Labour Welfare Board, claiming the centre was not being utilised to the optimum, has asked for the eviction. Chaudhury, meanwhile, has put forth the relevance of the centre towards rescue, shelter and rehabilitation of the HIV positive labourers. ,Chaudhury is also a member of the HC-appointed monitoring committee to oversee mental health activities related to women, children, labourers and homeless. ,""This court is of the view that the centre should be permitted an opportunity of satisfying the Labour Commissioner that it was carrying on, at the time of inspection and also subsequently, the activities as envisaged in the Memorandum of Understanding. Chaudhary will appear with all the relevant records before the Commissioner on April 25. The Commissioner will examine the records and also satisfy himself that the notes of inspection on file substantiate what has been stated in the report,"" ordered the court. ,The Commissioner, the court said, will then forward his decision to the Labour Welfare Board, within two weeks, and a fresh decision will be taken by the Board in four weeks thereafter.,To ensure that the patients do not suffer due to the eviction, Justice Muralidhar said: ""The Board will also consider if the centre can be given an alternative space for carrying on the activities envisaged by the MOU."",Chaudhary told Newsline said this is the only institution in the city that has a 'Family Rehabilitation Model' for the abandoned and destitute HIV positive labourers. ,""This is the only centre designated for the labourer community that has the facility of Half-Way-Home. Besides, HIV positive people, the centre also caters to victims of mental illness and brain disorders.

To meet the needs of the callers, new topics closely related to HIV like tuberculosis and hepatitis have been included in the scope of the helpline and training has been provided to the counsellors, says Oswal.

,
More than a year after the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommended phasing out Stavudine for treatment of HIV, India has decided to switch to Tenofovir — a drug four times more expensive but less toxic.,Forty-five per cent of the patients in the country use Stavudine or d4T. However, in guidelines issued in December 2009, the WHO had recommended that the drug be phased out due to long-term irreversible side-effects.,Consequently, the techniqual resource group has decided to do away with Stavudine for first-line treatment in a phased manner. Tenofovir, a second-line treatment, will now be used more extensively. However in case of patients who are anaemic, antiretroviral therapy (ART) centres have been asked to use Tenofovir as a first option.,""We will be able to completely phase out Stavudine in another next two years. Even as the toxicity of Stavudine has been found to be as low as 2.1 in Indian patients, we have decided to go by international guidelines,"" said Dr B B Rewari, National Programme Officer, ART. ,While the most preferred drug in India is Zidovudine, as it is less toxic and equally effective and just twice as expensive as Stavudine — 55 per cent of Indian patients use it — it cannot be given to those having anaemia.,,Civil society organisations have alleged lack of transparency in India's national AIDS programme. A five-member delegation representing 90 civil society organisations met officials at NACO to convey that there was need for greater consultation with community groups to ensure a meaningful design for the proposed National AIDS Control Programme IV.

A little less than half the patients on treatment since 2005 — as many as 4,500 — have succumbed to AIDS, according to records at the anti-retroviral treatment (ART) centre of the Sassoon General Hospital. The ART centres in the city will soon start the second-line regimen of drugs to prevent further deaths. ,As many as 23,000 persons living with HIV have registered themselves at the Sassoon ART centre, which has been functional since 2005. While a majority of these patients hail from the city and surrounding areas, there are 10,000  persons on treatment now, of whom 700 are children. ,The resistance to the first-line drugs had led to an increasing demand for second line of treatment, which was available at an exorbitant cost in the private sector till now. JJ Hospital in Mumbai was the sole government centre distributing the second-line drugs so far. ,Dr D B Kadam, head of ART centre, Sassoon Hospital, said around 250 persons from Pune had been sent to JJ Hospital for the second-line drugs and 45 persons were already on these drugs.  With the new development, those living with HIV who cannot tolerate the first line of treatment will not have to travel to Mumbai for second-line drugs. Drugs have already been sent to the four ART centres — at Sassoon, YCM Hospital, Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC) and National AIDS Research Institute (NARI). ,Ramesh Deokar, project director of Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS), said the second-line drugs would also be made available in Aurangabad and Nagpur. ,A Supreme Court directive had earlier allowed patients taking second-line drugs against HIV/AIDS to shift from private hospitals to government facilities. Kadam said Pune would start the second-line facility by mid-June.,Dr R S Paranjape, director of National AIDS Research Institute (NARI), said the tests were expensive and kits were needed to examine the plasma samples of patients. ""After the virus particles are detected in samples, we can identify the person for second-line drugs."",Meanwhile, various organisations in Pune will join the global AIDS Week of Action to remember those who have lost their lives to AIDS by conducting a candlelight memorial on May 15. The event will also welcome the decision to provide the second-line drugs at ART centres in the city. The theme of the 2011 candlelight memorial is Touching lives.

With supply of HIV drugs unable to keep pace with demand, patients continue to suffer. Ramesh Deokar, Project Director of Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society, has admitted that there has been a shortage for the last four months. ""NACO procures the drugs and then distributes it to the ART(anti retroviral treatment) centres. There were problems with the procurement policy but now the issue is being addressed,"" he said. Stocks are being redistributed at various centres to meet demand, he claimed. ,While the government has said it will meet demand by May 28, centres continue to wait for drugs. Sassoon General Hospital's ART centre has been assured supply but the centrerun by the National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) at Model Colony is yet to get its stock. The ART centre at YCM Hospital in Pimpri faced many problems before it got regular supply of medicines. It now treats 100 patients daily.,In December 2010, the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) switched to Efavirenz (EFV) from Nevirapine (NVP) at its ART centres. The switch was attributed to excess stocks of EFV that NACO was keen to exhaust before it expired in March 2011. Now, there is a shortage of EFV at NARI's centre at Model Colony. Around 1,200 patients are taking the medication, including 200 new patients. Some are given NVP but those on TB treatment cannot be administered NVP,  said Dr Manisha Ghate, in charge of ART centre at NARI. ""We have spoken to Nashik and Gadchiroli centre and have requested additional stock,"" said Ghate.,ART centres at other parts of the country, including Allahabad, Gaya, Bhagalpur, Darbhanga, Muzzafarpur and Patna, also ran out of stock between February and May 2011. Drug stock-outs at facility level may lead to HIV and TB drug resistance, said Pardeshi. Several organisations have taken out rallies to draw the attention of the health ministry and the National AIDS Control Organisation to the issue. People living with HIV(PLHIV) networks had earlier called on the Health Ministry and NACO to reform the pharmaceutical supply management system for essential medicines as it an important element in treatment programmes. Manoj Pardeshi, Pune-based national coordinator of the International Treatment Preparedness Coalition of people living with HIV, said problems at ART treatment centres need to be addressed urgently.

A molecule extracted from a marine micro-organism, found off the coast of Rameshwaram, could potentially be the next biggest development in treating TB and HIV, claimed researchers here on Wednesday.,Offering new hope to those living with HIV as well as TB patients, a group of scientists from the Tuberculosis Research Centre (TRC), IIT-Madras and Periyar University claim to have extracted the molecule, Transitmycin, from the marine micro-organism, 'Streptomyces sp', that was isolated from a soil sample collected from the coral reef off the coast of Rameshwaram. The brominated and pigmented antibiotic has been found to be active against both TB and HIV, said researchers.,""Transitmycin inhibited drug sensitive, multidrug resistant (MDR) and XDR Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains as well as bacterial pathogens,"" said Dr Vanaja Kumar, principal investigator and head of the department of bacteriology at the TRC. It was also found to be active against latent bacilli, said the researchers. Enthusing them further, the compound was found to inhibit two most widely prevalent clades of HIV-1, the subtypes B & C. ,Experts said the latter subtype was most prevalent in India and parts of the African continent, reportedly responsible for the worst epidemics and around half of all infections. ,Importantly, this compound is found to be effective against both Mycobacterium and HIV, a unique feature that enables the treatment of patients who have been infected with both these pathogens unlike the existing medicines that cannot be administered simultaneously as they counteract, said the scientists. ,Preclinical research, including animal studies, are to be taken up prior to testing this compound in human clinical trials, they said, adding that it would be ready in 10 years if the plan fell in place.

,,Hari Shankar Prasad loves talking to people. ""Call it passion or pesha, I love explaining the concept of HIV to people. Unfortunately there is still a dangerous trend in this country to oversimplify HIV and just associate it with a horrible disease,"" says the 41- year-old. ,More than eight years after he was first diagnosed with HIV, the factory worker from Faridabad is an active volunteer for the Delhi Network of Positive people (DNP), attends English language classes with his wife, and has an ""educated son"". ,Every morning at 6.30 am, Prasad is up and about, helping his wife make breakfast.  ""Her CD4 count is lower than mine, so she is slightly unwell so it's nice to help her out,"" he says. CD-4 count is a standard test used by experts to determine when to start treatment for HIV positive patients.,After seeing the children off, Prasad and his wife are on their motorcycle and whizzing away to work, at the AIDS healthcare foundation near IGNOU. Every day she has to be dropped at 9.20 am, before he heads off to Safdarjung Hospital. ,A volunteer at the Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centre, Prasad gets lost in the crowd of patients within minutes of his arrival. ""Queries about starting treatment, which drugs to take, what to say at work and home--there are endless lifestyle issues with HIV,"" he explains. ,With no desk to sit at, Prasad says he prefers walking into the crowd, and randomly approaching people to see if they need help. ""There are so many confused, scared faces. After so many years, people know me, and I also understand who needs help,"" he says. ,Prasad got to know about his own HIV status in 2002, at the same hospital, months before his first wife succumbed to the disease. It took him two years and ""bucket loads of courage"", to tell his brother--the only one in the family who still knows, about his HIV diagnosis in a handwritten letter he slipped into his pocket.,Take the history into consideration, and Prasad's opening lines to every patient, suddenly make sense. A diminutive lady with a pallu covering her head walks up to him and whispers something. He takes her by the hand. ""Remember, no one should suffer from HIV because of lack of treatment. Just take the drugs every 12 hours,"" he says.,By 1 pm Prasad heads to his office at the Network of Positive Peoples' office near the IGNOU campus. Prasad is ready to wear the administrative cap, after being recently elected board member of the body that was formed about ten years ago. ,Prasad recalls how he met his present wife and her daughter at an HIV patients conclave in 2008. ""She was from Bhagalpur and had also lost her first husband to HIV. The villagers did not even let the family cremate the body because they feared the virus would spread by the fumes of the burning ashes. Her in-laws believed her to be responsible for his death, and though she was also diagnosed with HIV and was on treatment, they took her medicines away and threw her out,"" he says. After nearly a year of knowing each other, the two decided to get married and bring their children under one roof. ""Our children our studying and thankfully both are negative for HIV,"" says Prasad.,Later in the day, Prasad is called at another leading hospital in the city where a lab assistant allegedly refused to draw an HIV positive patient's blood. A drive of about half-an-hour, and Prasad takes the patient back inside the hospital with a written complaint to the hospital head. The response is immediate. Within hours, the blood is drawn, though action against the assistant is still awaited.

,

,

,
,


,
It is not clear what ultimately killed Vinu Gohil and his entire family: HIV, or ostracisation, humiliation, loneliness and hunger. No one in this village in Bhavnagar's Ghogha taluka is keen to know anyway.,Forty-five-year-old Vinu died on Wednesday, three days after his three young daughters — Krishna (16), Rinku (12) and Daxa (10) — killed themselves, unable to bear the taunts, curses and the pariah life of the last six years. ,Vinu's wife Vilas and their two-year-old son Ajay died in 2005, the first victims of the virus which Vilas is suspected to have contracted through the transfusion of infected blood during the delivery of her first child at the local hospital. The village ostracised and shunned the family, and Vinu was forced to leave his pucca home with his daughters and move to a small thatched hut at  the edge of the village. The three girls never went to school again.,On Friday, the hut stood empty and desolate, a row of  fading gods looking down from pictures on the wall at a torn blanket on the only charpoy, a rotting wooden cupboard and a soot-blackened chulha.,There was evidence young girls lived here — next to the utensils strewn on the floor were, along with a few toys, an empty packet of fairness cream, some bindis and a purse on which was scrawled 'Aa Daxa ba nu purse chhe (This purse belongs to Daxa ba).',No one, not even Vinu's brothers, ever visited the family, so it isn't clear what Vinu and his daughters ate to survive. Vinu had two bighas of land that he once farmed groundnut and cotton on, but the infection had confined him to bed for years. No one visited him even after his daughters killed themselves.,A local man, Udaysinh Jadeja, pointed the hut out to The Indian Express from some 50 metres away. Two young girls who were among the family's closest neighbours, said, ""They (Vinu's daughters) were never our friends. We do not know anything."",Vinu's elder brother Ghanubhai — who, along with another brother Babubhai, lives nearby — said he had not visited his brother's home since the time it became known they had AIDS.,""They were not allowed into the village temple. At all social functions, they were made to sit and eat separately,"" Ghanubhai said. Asked when he last spoke to Krishna, Rinku or Daxa, he said, ""I can't remember."",A neighbour said simply, ""We were afraid of the family."",According to Ghanubhai, Vilas was likely infected in a hospital at Dhuvaran village in Khambhat. No one knew until 2005, when their youngest child Ajay fell very ill and doctors said he was HIV positive. Tests then showed the entire family was carrying the virus. Ajay died soon, and his mother went two months later.,Dr D B Vyas, District AIDS Officer attached to the Gujarat State Aids Control Society, claimed that they could not help because the family refused anti-retroviral treatment.,""They had registered with us, but in 2007, Vinu gave a written declaration that he and his family no longer wished to receive treatment. Since 2007, they had been approached to restart the treatment no less than five times, but they remained adamant."", Neeta Kavaviya, who works with an NGO supporting HIV positive people, said Vinu's relatives shunned the family completely. It was ultimately the isolation that perhaps forced the three girls to open the tin of pesticide that Vinu had once bought to use on his small farm.

As the country is preparing to draft the new National AIDS Control Programme, a study has revealed that over 72 per cent of the children living with the disease in West Bengal belong to below poverty line families.  ,The study, which was conducted by the Unicef office of Bengal and Bengal Network of People living with HIV/AIDS, was held between January 2009 and September 2010. It covered 857 HIV-affected children of 995 families.,The study said of these 995 families, 12 per cent were unemployed, 40 per cent depended on daily wages, 10 per cent were engaged in agriculture and 23 percent were part of unorganised sector. ,Besides, 29 per cent fathers and 33 per cent mothers of the affected children were illiterate. ,According to the number of the children registered for pre-Antiretroviral Treatment (ART) in health centers across the state, around 1500 children are affected with HIV in the state. ,Among the children living with HIV, 27 per cent had lost their fathers and 11 per cent their mothers due to HIV infection and six percent are orphans. ,A district-wise analysis reveals the largest number of HIV-affected children were from North 24 Parganas (14.5 per cent), followed by South 24 Parganas ( 9 per cent), Kolkata, East Midnapore, Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling. ,The study also revealed that 11 per cent children were infected through blood transfusion, while 83 per cent were infected  by mother-to-child transmission. Although mother-to-child infection can  be  prevented,  the  report revealed 49 per cent of the mothers  did not  avail of the Prevention of Parent To Child Transmission (PPTCT) treatment. ,Only 41 per cent children were diagnosed with the HIV below five years of their age. Moreover, only 16 per cent are receiving Antiretroviral Treatment (ART). ,Discussing the situation in the state, Dr RK Vats, the project director of State AIDS Control and Prevention Society, ""Despite an overall  increase in the accessibility of ART and increased efforts to check the new HIV infections among  infants and children, the challenges remain."",""Implementing agencies need to intensify the follow-up exercise and address the issue of social stigma,"" said Kaninika Mitra, Health & HIV specialist, state Unicef office. ,Incidentally, the study report was compiled by 60 HIV positive members of the Network.

Gay and bisexual men account for about one in every three new cases of HIV in China which has about 7.5 lakh people affected by HIV/AIDS syndrome.,About five per cent of the group, officially termed men who have sex with men, or MSM  are living with the virus, which is 88 times higher than the national HIV prevalence rate of 0.057 per cent, figures released by Chinese Health Ministry has said.,The problem is acute in large urban centres where the prevalence rate is almost 20 per cent, it said.,According to official estimates, China's population of gays is anywhere between five and ten million but Zhang Beichun, a leading expert on HIV at Qingdao University puts it around 30 million, state run 'China Daily' reported on Monday.,However, the statistics also show that less than half of all gay and bisexual men have access to HIV screening, while about 15 per cent of those who are infected are not receiving treatment.,""Cities are at the heart of China's development and progress and must remain at the forefront of its HIV response,"" said Michel Sidibe, executive director of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), during a workshop on HIV impact on MSM in Chengdu, capital of Southwest China's Sichuan province.,""Through bold action cities can lead the way to achieving the UNAIDS vision of zero new HIV infections, zero discrimination and zero AIDS-related deaths,"" he said, according to a UNAIDS release.,""We hope that over the next  many more Chinese cities will implement MSM strategies,"" he said.,According to UNAIDS China had an estimated 740,000 people living with HIV/AIDS in 2009.

A new strategy aims to bring HIV tests home. It will be based on an oral swab-based test, but the results can be read at home and the person who has taken the test can then check for its accuracy by following up the results with counselling over the phone, with blood tests if necessary, says the doctor who is working on the strategy.,Nitika Pai, of Indian origin and now a permanent resident of Canada, said HIV tests can detect the virus in either serum, saliva or plasma. What she has planned is the use of one of the existing kits so that the swab is placed in the mouth and the oral fluid is then mixed in a vial amid ""a developing situation"". The results are read from a stick-like testing device. How accurate the finding is, can be later followed up with counselling and then subsequently a blood test, she says.,Her husband, Prof Madhukar Pai, is meanwhile working on an accurate, low-cost test for tuberculosis. He plans to use biomarkers like abdominal fluid. ""We will take two biomarkers and then put it on a strip test which can detect the disease. The strip test will barely cost Rs 100 to Rs 150 and the results will be validated with our researchers in India,"" he told The Indian Express.,The Pais, who trained in Allahabad and Vellore, now work at McGill University, Montreal. He is associate professor in the department of epidemiology & biostatistics; she is assistant professor of medicine.,They said they have tied up with Indian companies to devise the two tests. Each has won an award of $100,000 to follow up his or her strategy. The awards are part of an initiative of Grand Challenges Canada — Canadian Rising Stars in Global Health. Grand Challenges Canada is a non-profit organisation working on health initiatives in developing countries. ,The awards are initially for up to 18 months; if the tests are reviewed successfully, scaled-up grants of up to $1million for two to three years may be awarded.,Nitika Pai's idea is to develop an integrated, public health-oriented, self-testing strategy that uses the internet, mobile phones, and rapid point-of-care HIV tests. Such a personalised HIV self-testing strategy will aim for a social innovation and ending stigma/discrimination associated with HIV, she said.,""We are entering an era of personalised medicine. There is a lot of stigma around HIV. There is fear of disclosure. There aren't enough counsellors. Self-testing for HIV is needed by those who desire a confidential private option that allows one to know their status in the privacy of their homes,"" she said, adding that they were in the process of finalising partners in South Africa and India.,Madhukar Pai said that TB, a disease that kills millions of people, is hard to diagnose, and there is no accurate, rapid, low-cost test. He hopes to make the tests eventually available at under $2 each. The test will be co-developed with Tulip Group in Goa, with clinical validation at the Christian Medical College in Vellore.

HIV-TB patients responded poorly to the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) regimen, a study by National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) says, which saw high mortality rates during treatment and follow-up.,While the current RNTCP regimen is highly effective in the management of tuberculosis patients without HIV infection, there is however insufficient information about their efficacy in HIV associated TB.  The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), commissioned two task force studies in Pune and Chennai to determine the efficacy of the directly observed intermittent short course (DOTS) -RNTCP regimens in pulmonary tuberculosis patients having concurrent HIV infection. Dr R S Paranjape, NARI director told The Indian Express that the study was done over a period of three -four years and  was published in this year's May issue of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). ,""We found that there was a need to streamline the management of HIV-TB co infected patients and expose them to anti retroviral treatment (ART) to achieve higher cure rates for TB and reduce mortality rates,""he said.The study also supports National AIDS Control Organisation's policy of now starting ART for TB patients with HIV when their CD-4 (viral load) count is 350 and not 250.,According to  principal investigator of the project Dr S Tripathy, the study had involved a total of 283 TB patients from the outpatient department at Talera hospital of Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation.There were 121 HIV positive and 162 HIV negative patients. They were treated for tuberculosis as per the RNTCP. According to the researchers the patients had not been exposed to free ART that time. ,Treatment success rates were substantially lower in HIV positive patients than in HIV negative patients,  (80 out of 121 HIV  positive) and  (137 out of 162). Researchers pointed out that mortality rates were significantly higher in HIV positive patients.,Among 121 HIV seropositive tuberculosis patients, 29 expired before the completion of the anti-TB treatment. Of the remaining 92 who were alive at the end of 6 months of anti-TB treatment, 32 died during the follow up period, 14 due to tuberculosis, 7 due to AIDS related causes other than tuberculosis and 11 due to unknown reasons. Overall, in the 162 HIV seronegative tuberculosis patients, there were 6  deaths (5 TB, 1 non-TB). In the 121 HIV seropositive tuberculosis patients, there were 61  deaths (43 TB, 18 non-TB).,Now the researchers at NARI are studying which is the most effective regimen of ART for the HIV-TB patients. ,The use of nevirapine or efivarenz drug for treating HIV with TB. ,The interaction between rifampicin used for treating TB and many of the ART drugs also entails either avoiding one or the other of the ART drugs or to complete a course of anti-TB treatment first and then start ART drugs. ,Some of these deaths could be prevented by initiating ART within a short period of starting anti tuberculosis treatment, say researchers.

The findings add to growing evidence that the type of medicines prescribed since the mid-1990s to treat people who are already sick may also hold the key to slowing or even halting the spread of the sexually transmitted disease.,The research involving couples in Kenya, Uganda and Botswana found that daily AIDS drugs reduced infection rates by an average of at least 62 per cent when compared with placebo.,""Effective new HIV prevention tools are urgently needed and these studies could have enormous impact in preventing heterosexual transmission,"" Margaret Chan, director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), said in a statement.,She said the United Nations health agency would now work with countries to use the new findings to implement better protection strategies.,The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention plans to review the data and issue its own guidelines - taking into account issues such as whether behavior may change when people know they are taking a drug that reduces infection risk, said Dr. Jonathan Mermin, CDC director HIV/AIDS prevention.,In its first official guidance on the topic, the CDC said in January that only high-risk gay and bisexual men should use a daily AIDS pill to protect themselves from the virus.,The larger of the two new studies examined 4,758 ""discordant"" couples in Kenya and Uganda in which one partner was HIV-positive and one was negative. Those negative partners taking Gilead Sciences Inc's tenofovir, or Viread, had on average 62 per cent fewer infections.,For couples on Truvada - another Gilead drug combining tenofovir and emtricitabine - the infection risk was cut by an estimated 73 per cent in the clinical trial, which was led by researchers at the University of Washington.,Dr. Jared Baeten, principal investigator of the study funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, said real-life application of the results has not been determined. But Baetennoted that ""discordant"" couples who want to have children may now have an alternative to condoms.,The second study, involving just over 1,200 sexually active men and women in Botswana, found those on daily Truvada reduced their risk of HIV infection by 62.6 per cent.,Lead investigator, Dr. Michael Thigpen, said Truvada proved to be safe and effective. He said the drug - along with things like male circumcision, topical microbicide gels and condoms - could be another tool for preventing the spread of HIV.,The idea of such ""pre-exposure prophylaxis,"" known as PrEP, has gained traction in the past year, following results of other research showing a fall in infection rates among gay men taking AIDS drugs.,However, PrEP took a knock earlier this year when another study failed to demonstrate a protective effect in high-risk women. The latest strong evidence is likely to restore confidence in the approach.,Around 33 million people worldwide have the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS, most living in Africa and Asia. Only about half know their HIV status, and the WHO hopes that news of an effective approach to prevention will encourage more people to get tested.,Michel Sidibe, head of the UN's program on HIV/AIDS, said the new studies ""could help us to reach the tipping point in the HIV epidemic."",The larger study, conducted in Kenya and Uganda, had been scheduled to run until late 2012 but its placebo arm was stopped early because the evidence of efficacy was so strong.,Results of the Botswana study, led by the CDC, had been due to be unveiled next week at an international AIDS congress in Rome but were released ahead of time to coincide with the University of Washington research.,AIDS drugs are available as generics in many poor countries at prices as low as 25 US cents a tablet, according to the WHO. Prices could fall further and supplies increased following an agreement by Gilead, the leading maker of HIV drugs, to share intellectual property rights on its medicines in a new patent pool. The California-based group on Tuesday became the first drugmaker to sign up to the Medicines Patent Pool.,

A major study is aiming to discover whether applying a vaccine patch to the skin with thousands of tiny micro-needles could help boost the body's immune response and prevent the spread of life-threatening infections like HIV and TB.,The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have awarded Professor Vincent Piguet from Cardiff University's School of Medicine almost a million dollars to examine how key immune cells in the skin can be targeted to cause the immune system to produce antibodies against infection.,The new research will examine how targeting the vaccine at a specific area of the skin and modulating these cells could help boost the body's response to the vaccine and prevent the transmission and progression of the infection.,""Our two studies will target key cells called dendritic cells in the skin,"" said Professor Piguet, who leads the Cardiff research.,Dentritic cells are our body's first line of defence against infections like HIV and TB. They also help determine how our immune system responds to infection.Using small micro-needles in a patch applied to the skin we hope we can target these cells more efficiently and help induce the body's immunity against HIV as well as other serious infections like TB and CMV.,""We will also seek to modulate the dendritic cells functions – by doing, we hope to increase their potency and therefore increase the body's immune response,"" he added.,The Cardiff team including colleagues from Switzerland, the University of Oxford and Harvard University, will use human blood and skin cells to map the immune response and mimic the human response.

Scientists have created a type of vaginal bacteria to combat the spread of HIV among women.,Dean Hamer of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, and colleagues replicated the bacteria produced naturally by the body to produce the anti-HIV protein cyanovirin-N.,They applied a gel containing the bacteria to the vaginas of rhesus macaques before infecting them by the same route with a hybrid of SIV and HIV.,The engineered bacteria cut the infection rate by 63 percent, reports New Scientist.,Human females have 10 times as much of the bacteria as female macaques, so the engineered bacteria could reduce infection rates even more dramatically, says Hamer.,Clinical tests could begin within a few years after it is proved that the treatment is safe.

Scientists have developed a portable blood test device which they say diagnoses an infection within minutes and can be an effective weapon in the fight against HIV and AIDS in the developing world.,Developed by scientists at the University of Columbia in New York, the mChip, which costs only $1 and looks like a credit card, has proved almost 100 per cent accurate in testing HIV in Rwanda.,Hundreds of tests using a prototype were carried out in the town of Kigali and returned a 95 per cent accuracy for HIV and 76 per cent for syphilis, the Daily Mail reported.,""The idea is to make a large class of diagnostic tests accessible to patients in any setting in the world, rather than forcing them to go to a clinic to draw blood and then wait days for their results,"" said Professor Samuel Sia, who led the team that developed the plastic device. ,According to the researchers, the mChip uses optics to read fluids by taking a single pin-prick of blood.,It contains 10 detection zones which the blood passes through and then returns a positive or negative result for HIV/AIDS or syphilis in about 15 minutes.,The result is presented in a simple colour-coded manner similar to a pregnancy test, making it extremely easy to use and understand.,An alternative is to use a cheap detector box -- the ""lab"" -- to check the results.,The mChip's low cost and efficiency has been hailed as a major breakthrough in the fight against HIV in the developing world.,Drugs to place HIV in remission have long been available, but have been deemed too expensive to use on a widescale basis.,The mChip, on the other hand, is extremely cheap, can fit in an aid worker's pocket and produces a result with a high degree of accuracy within 15 minutes.,The researchers are now hoping to increase testing for sexually transmitted diseases in pregnant women in Africa.

,
In the eight years since the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation launched an HIV prevention initiative in India under its Global Health Program, the country has changed the way it looks at the disease, better checks are in place, and the scare itself has subsided, with 2007 estimates halving the number of infected people to between 2.5 and 3.1 million.,The numbers may be encouraging but ""it's way too early to declare a victory"", says Ashok Alexander, director of Avahan, the initiative to reduce the spread of HIV in India. The virus is powerful and capable of coming back, he warns, a signal to the government which is in the process of taking over the various programmes under Avahan.,Launched in 2003, Avahan is now in the process of transferring its programmes. ""Around 30 per cent"" of these have already been ""transferred"", with the remaining 70 per cent to follow by next year. The Gates Foundation will focus on other diseases of concern, such as polio and maternal and child healthcare.,Alexander is hoping the government will continue the techniques Avahan had used to mobilise communities, such as helping sex workers set up beauty salons, pushing the use of contraceptives, and introducing paan-flavoured condoms.,He says it took an effort at the beginning. ""Back in 2003, there was a feeling that the virus would grow and the epidemic would go haywire. We talked to experts but they said we were crazy. There was a lot of denial; funding was on a limited scale and there was little focus on prevention. HIV didn't figure in the list of priorities of sex workers when we asked them."",The foundation conveyed its message better in the next two years. He says HIV incidence has declined in all major states, condom usage gone up and sexually transmitted infections gone down. ,Avahan has provided funding and support to targeted HIV prevention programmes in the six states with the highest prevalence, and along the nation's major trucking routes. The target groups are those most vulnerable, including sex workers, their clients and partners, high-risk men who have sex with men, and injecting drug users.,In July 2009, the foundation had announced that it had increased its total commitment to Avahan from $258 million to $338 million. Alexander says the foundation's AIDS initiative was designed on the lines of a build-operate-transfer model.

A 26-year-old HIV patient, who committed suicide by jumping from the seventh floor of the Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital early on Sunday morning, was reportedly suffering from depression. ,A senior nursing orderly at ward number 27 of the hospital said she often saw the patient ""sitting on the bed, weeping"", even as his young wife comforted him. ""I used to see the patient everyday, after he was admitted here, and he always complained of severe headache and vomiting. He would often break down and cry, but his wife was very supportive,"" she said. ,The victim was admitted to GTB Hospital on Thursday morning, after he complained of excessive vomiting, nausea and headache. He was suffering from tuberculosis with cryptococcal meningitis. ,""The victim was HIV-positive and highly depressed. His wife told us that he became very tense after being diagnosed with other illnesses. We, in turn, asked her to be particularly careful because he seemed to be suffering from severe depression. At 6 am on Sunday, a nurse saw him walking to the bathroom. When she returned, the patient was not on his bed,"" said Dr Rajpal, Medical Superintendent, GTB Hospital. ,The nurse woke the wife up, and asked a guard to check if the patient was still in the bathroom. ""But he was not there. He was found dead in the park. He had jumped from the bathroom window, sustaining severe head injuries,"" Dr Rajpal said. ,Meanwhile, the couple's house in Gagan Vihar, Ghaziabad, has become the centre of attention in the neighbourhood. According to one of the neighbours, the patient was a street vendor who used to live with his wife and two children, aged five and seven, in a rented house. ,""The patient and his wife would prepare golgappa and chaat at home, and sell them in the evening. They had moved into this house from their native village in Etawah four years ago. ,He was a silent person, an introvert. Though he never drank or smoke, he always seemed tense.

,


,
A collection of 17 broadly neutralising antibodies against HIV that reveals a number of new targets for vaccine design has been discovered by a team of researchers at the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative. Talking to The Sunday Express, Dr Wayne Koff, who has been spearheading this research team at IAVI, said that with 7,000 new HIV infections occurring every day, and 9 million HIV-infected individuals unable to access life-saving antiretroviral medication, developing an effective and accessible AIDS vaccine has never been more critical. ""Our research has been successful in terms of mapping the route for eliciting HIV neutralising antibodies,"" he said. The researchers also included a team from The Scripps Research Institute, Theraclone Sciences and Monogram Biosciences Inc., a LabCorp company, USA.,The new antibodies, large protein molecules that bind to pathogens and flag them for destruction, were isolated from blood serum samples collected in a continuing global search for broadly neutralising antibodies (bNAbs) launched by IAVI. They should provide researchers with a new set of targets for the design of vaccine candidates that can elicit similar antibodies to protect people from contracting HIV. Some of the bNAbs blocked HIV infection of cells as much as 10 to 100 times as potently as previously discovered bNAbs, Dr Koff said in an email interview.,The current issue of the journal Nature has reported the discovery, which essentially provides scientists with new clues essential to designing an effective vaccine. Mapping the route of these antibodies is challenging and scientists begin by studying the natural history of HIV infection in individuals. They use samples collected during the course of infection to identify individuals who develop potent broadly neutralising antibodies against HIV and assess how and when these responses developed. IAVI and partners have a clinical protocol in Sub-Saharan Africa focused on the natural history of HIV infection, where they are following approximately 500 HIV-infected volunteers.,The second method, known as deep sequencing and recently reported in the journal Science by IAVI partners at the US NIH, complements the first method. Scientists assessed the repertoire of genes coding for antibodies in individuals in which broadly neutralising antibodies have been identified. This approach enables scientists to determine the progenitor of broadly neutralising antibodies as well as the genetic changes that occur in the antibodies over time, which resulted in their capability to become broadly neutralising. This information is then used to guide the design of vaccines aimed at eliciting such antibodies.Researchers prize bNAbs because their structural and biochemical analysis can reveal how to achieve a preventive vaccine. Scientists expect that they can use information about how bNAbs bind to HIV to construct immunogens—the active ingredients of vaccines—that elicit similar antibodies.,,* The Indian Medicinal Chemistry Program (IMCP), a partnership between IAVI, the Indian Institute of Sciences (IISc), the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biology (ICGEB), TCG Lifesciences, and Anthem Biosciences under the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India, is comprised of top Indian and US scientists working to accelerate AIDS vaccine design,* Earlier this year, IAVI and the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI) in Delhi, an autonomous institute under DBT, announced the establishment of a collaborative program for HIV Vaccine Development in India. The programme will focus on the elicitation of broadly neutralising antibodies and the design of corresponding immunogens,* On November 25, 2009, the Indo-South Africa Joint Committee on Science and Technology Cooperation announced a scientific collaboration between scientists from South Africa and India to help define the antigens required to control HIV infection

A survey of children living with HIV in Pune, Satara and Sangli, carried out by the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society  (MSACS) shows that discrimination still continues. The study found discrimination against HIV positive children by teachers.,Dr Dilip Deshmukh, Assistant Project Director of MSACS giving the keynote address at a state level consultation on the right to education of children with HIV on Thursday stressed the need for an effective response to address stigma and discrimination against children living with HIV in schools. He said unreported incidents were several times more than reported cases of discrimination.,""There is a need to change the mindset of parents whose initial response is fear of their children interacting with those living with HIV,"" Deshmukh said.,He pointed out that during their interaction with children living with HIV from Pune, Satara and Sangli, it was learnt that they attend school but are ignored by teachers. ""We must create awareness among teachers and educators to stop playing with their emotions,"" Deshmukh said.,Socio-economic Development Trust (SEDT), Centre for Advocacy and Research and the Maharashtra Network of People Living with HIV (NMP+) conducted the meet. ,According to a study by CFAR, there were 45 incidents reported across the country of children being discriminated against at schools. Around 61 were expelled, 10 incidents took place in Maharashtra; in Pune, Latur, Amravati and Nagpur. According to CFAR officials, most of the incidents were in government schools and six were after the Right to Education Act was introduced.,Deshmukh admitted that the state has a high number of orphans and vulnerable children. Of an estimated 20,000 children living with HIV, 6,000 are on anti-retro viral treatment. He said stigma and discrimination can be effectively removed with combined support of all stakeholders.,Suryakant Kulkarni, state representative of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, said there was lack of awareness on RTE in several districts of Vidarbha. He asked NGOs to work along with school management committees to ensure children living with HIV are not discriminated against. ""We urge people to speak up and complain,"" Kulkarni said.,Child rights activists and representatives of NGOs working on HIV from 26 districts on Thursday unanimously drafted recommendations to ensure right to education of children living with HIV. ,Sensitizing education officials, teachers, school staff and parents, pushing for inclusion of sex education in the syllabus, monitoring incidents of discrimination were among the recommended steps.

Pregnant women and TB patients in villages will no longer need to travel to far off places to check HIV status. For the first time, the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) will introduce a whole blood screening test to be conducted by auxillary nursing midwives (ANM's) at village health centres.,Assistant Project Director, MSACS, Dr Dilip Deshmukh told The Indian Express that just like a pregnancy kit, the new HIV detection kit will indicate whether the person has tested positive or negative. This will be the initial screening at the village dispensary. The patient will then be sent to Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC) at tehsils.,According to in-charge of Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission (PPTCT) programme of MSACS Dr Asha Hegde, blood will be collected through a finger prick and tested on the card. In case it shows positive, the patient will be directed to the ICTC for further confirmation. There are three such tests. However, the initial screening at the village level will help check pregnant women at her doorstep. This blood test will be peformed at sub-centres and village-level dispensaries. A total of 4,000 ANMs are being trained to conduct the test. ,The prevalence of HIV infection in pregnant women has come down from 3 per cent to 0.3 per cent , said Deshmukh. Apart from ANMs, lab technicians under the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme will be trained to conduct the test in villages. Subsequently, a pilot project will be introduced in Solapur and depending on the success of the programme, it will be expanded to 10 high-risk districts in the state, Hegde said.,The National AIDS Control Organisation is spending Rs 73 crore on various interventions and programmes conducted by MSACS via 163 NGOs. According to Deshmukh, an estimated 4.5 lakh people are living with HIV in Maharashtra, out of which 1.3 lakh people are on anti-retroviral treatment provided free of cost at government centres. There are an estimated 20,000 children living with HIV in the state, out of which 6,000 are on ART.,There is another programme that aims at detecting children as early as six weeks is the Early Infant Diagnosis project and according to MSACS, this method was used to check 3,944 babies at six weeks from April 2010 to June 2011. Out of 3,944, 428 were tested positive. A total of 180 babies less than one and a half year old are on ART now, said Hegde.

After introducing mobile blood banks, the Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS) has turned to mobile phones to spread awareness about HIV. On the International Youth Day on Friday, MDACS launched a mobile phone game called The Protector to educate the youth about the necessity to use condoms.,""The game was launched to target today's e-savvy generation and make them more comfortable with the concept of condoms and HIV. This is also a non-invasive means to reach the youths in slums as everyone owns a cellphone nowadays,"" said Dr S Kudalkar, project manager, MDACS. ,""The word condom is used freely in the game so that the idea of condoms as protection gets instilled in the mind of the young player who will then apply the same in real life as well,"" said Kudalkar. The game can be downloaded free of cost from the Internet. ,The Protector centres around a 20-year-old's travel through playgrounds, slums and corporate settings as he confronts drug dealers, syringes and HIV virus. As he battles various hurdles, he must turn to condoms to get an energy boost.,The launch of the game was part of MDACS 'Make a Friend for Life' campaign which aims to educate the youths about HIV and blood donation. ""Around 100 MDACS Red Ribbon Club kiosks will be set up at Ganesh pandals to encourage people to donate blood. A Red Ribbon Club page has also been set up on Facebook to encourage HIV affected to come forward and talk about their problems,"" said an MDACS official.

A new lab-based study led by scientists at the Imperial College London and Johns Hopkins University has found a way to prevent HIV from damaging the immune system.,The finding could have important implications for the development of HIV vaccines.,The research found that HIV is unable to damage the immune system if cholesterol is removed from the virus's membrane.,Usually, when a person becomes infected, the body's innate immune response provides an immediate defence. However, some researchers believe that HIV causes the innate immune system to overreact and that this weakens the immune system's next line of defence, known as the adaptive immune response.,In the new study, the researchers removed cholesterol from the membrane surrounding the virus and found that this stopped HIV from triggering the innate immune response.,This led to a stronger adaptive response, orchestrated by immune cells called T cells. These results support the idea that HIV overstimulates the innate response and that this weakens the immune system.,""It's like an army that has lost its weapons but still has flags, so another army can recognise it and attack it,"" said Dr Adriano Boasso, first author of the study, from Imperial College London.,The study was published in the journal Blood.

Scientists have developed glow in the dark cats with intrinsic immunity to the feline AIDS virus to help combat the disease in cats and humans.,Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) causes AIDS in cats as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) does in people: by depleting the body's infection-fighting T-cells.,The purpose of the study was to show how a natural protein that prevents macaque monkeys developing AIDS can do the same in cats.,The Mayo team of physicians, virologists, veterinarians and gene therapy researchers, along with collaborators in Japan, thus devised a way to insert effective monkey versions of them into the cat genome.,The technique is called gamete-targeted lentiviral transgenesis -- essentially, inserting genes into feline oocytes (eggs) before sperm fertilization.,Succeeding with it for the first time in a carnivore, the team inserted a gene for a rhesus macaque restriction factor known to block cell infection by FIV, as well as a jellyfish gene for tracking purposes. The latter makes the offspring cats glow green.,The macaque restriction factor blocks FIV by attacking and disabling the virus's outer shield as it tries to invade a cell.,""One of the best things about this biomedical research is that it is aimed at benefiting both human and feline health,"" says Eric Poeschla, M.D., Mayo molecular biologist and leader of the international study. ""It can help cats as much as people."",The study has been published in the current online issue of Nature Methods.

National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) director Dr R S Paranjape has cautioned against complacency in efforts to prevent and tackle HIV despite the declining number of people living with the disease. ""We need to intensify strategies to tackle the disease failing which there is likely to be a second wave,"" Paranjape said. ,There has been a gradual decline in prevalence of HIV in the last five years. Attention also has to be focussed on areas where prevalence still persists including several districts of Orissa and among high-risk groups like men having sex with men (MSM) and Injecting drug users (IDUs). ,In 2009, it was estimated that 2.4 million people are living with HIV and nearly four lakh are on Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART). Access to ART has improved quality of life and increased survival rates. ""However, there is a proportion of patients receiving ART but not responding to treatment, posing a challenge to scientists,"" said Paranjape. ,NARI, as part of its effort to prevent HIV, has submitted a proposal to create a database on Indian HIV-subtype C. There are several HIV patients on whom any kind of treatment has failed and scientists now want to understand this pattern of drug resistance.   ,""Treatment can be limited due to side effects and drug resistance and hence we have set up a virus bank to study the influence of the changes in the HIV genome,"" said Paranjape. NARI has been working for the last couple of years on the genetic make up of the virus. For the setting up of a database, we intend taking samples of patients from ART centres and studying the pattern of drug resistance, Paranjape said. ,NARI has already developed an HIV repository, the only one in India with strains collected from different parts of the country and contains different subtypes and recombinants. These strains would be useful for scientists to test anti-virals, candidate vaccine, microbicides as well as conducting basic laboratory research. ,Among areas decided as priority ones to intensify strategies for prevention are containing the twin HIV-TB co-infection and research on the human papilloma virus (HPV). Among HIV positive women, HPV infection is of particular concern as it may lead to cervical cancer. The focus will be on early detection.

After the  funding period expired, PSI approached MDACS to take over. ""When PSI requested us to handle the operations of the helpline, we put forth a proposal to National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) to integrate the helpline into MDACS,"" said Dr S Kudalkar, project director of MDACS. Funds to maintain the helpline will now be received from NACO. ,The PSI helpline counsellors have been absorbed into the MDACS helpline programme and the project has been relaunched as the MDACS Saadhan Helpline. Technical assistance has also been provided to MDACS. ""The software required for the helpline was transferred to us by PSI free of cost. This software would have otherwise cost us anywhere between Rs 20-25 lakh. Getting it free was a huge incentive for us to go ahead with the project,"" said Dr Kudalkar. ,The software will help MDACS keep a record of patient details for reference and produce monthly reports of the number and nature of calls received.,Saadhan helpline was launched in 2002 as a communication tool for people to come out and talk about HIV and AIDS-related problems. ""Communication and  access to information are major challenges in the  prevention of HIV and Saadhan helpline enables people to do both. It is also helpful for those who are positive and want to talk to someone without disclosing their identity. ,The MDACS Saadhan Helpline has received more than 250 calls within the first month of operations,"" said Vinitha Venkat, joint director communications of MDACS.

Over the past few days, a surge in demand for contraceptives has been seen by NGOs working to prevent HIV/AIDS in the city, who say it's a good sign as far as prevention of the disease is concerned. They are trying to meet the demand and have placed the new requirements with Pathfinder International that works along with Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) to distribute condoms in the city.,The demand is being attributed to an increase in number of visitors to the red light area located at Budhwar Peth, along with the rush of people from neighbouring places and districts for the festive season. ,Tejasvi Sevekari of Saheli, working for welfare of female sex workers, said  ""We have a target group of 1,000 and in the last fortnight distributed 3 lakh condoms. The demand for female contraceptives has remained almost the same."" ,Four NGOs are creating AIDS awareness and HIV prevention in the city and distributing condoms. Seema Waghmode of Kayakalp said 5,000 condoms have been distributed in the last few days. Pradeep Dalvi of Akhil Bharatiya Devdaasi Sanghatana said demand has nearly doubled. ""A recent survey shows approximately 3,500 female sex workers and around 1,000 men having sex with men in Budhwar Peth and surrounding areas.""   ,John Paul Slum Development in-charge George Swamy also condom demand had shot up among brothel-based female sex workers Dr Dilip Deshmukh, Additional Director of MSACS, several large cities get a fair share of people from neighbouring towns and there is a general trend of increase in demand for condoms. ,Officials said procurement of condoms for Maharashtra from National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) was 52 million for 2011-2012 as against last year's 39 million. ,""In Pune, prevalence of HIV infection is 0.7 per cent in the general population,"" says Dr R R Bamble, in-charge of the PMC-run Pune AIDS Control Society. The civic body has allocated Rs 15 lakh for creating awareness and distributing around two lakh condoms. ""During Ganesh festival, street plays are performed at prominent mandals,"" says Bamble pointing out that the focus is on educating the migrant population.

Physicians at a hospital in Taiwan that mistakenly transplanted four patients with HIV-infected organs may face criminal prosecution, an official said Friday.,The doctors involved may face up to 10 years in prison if found to have caused patients to contract the HIV virus by negligence, Taipei Prosecutors' Office spokesman Lin Wen-teh said.,Last week, Taipei's National Taiwan University Hospital performed the transplants of the liver, lungs and two kidneys from a donor it mistakenly believed was HIV negative. Another facility, National Chengkung University Hospital, transplanted the heart into a patient there based on NTUH's information.,NTUH, one of Taiwan's best medical institutions, said a staffer misheard the donor's test results as ""non-reactive"" when the English word ""reactive"" was actually given, meaning the donor had HIV. The information was given by telephone, and the hospital admitted the donor's HIV status was not double-checked as standard procedure required.,The head of the university hospital's transplant department, Ke Wen-che, resigned Thursday to take responsibility for the blunder. He said he was responsible for the transplant program in its entirety, and declined to blame either the staffer who mishandled the HIV information, or other physicians directly involved in the transplant procedures.,Meanwhile, the Health Department is also looking into the mistake. But department official Shih Chung-liang says it would be improper to put all blame on the staffer who mishandled the HIV test results. Still, he said, if negligence is found to have caused the blunder, NTUH may have to suspend its transplant programs for up to a year in addition to paying unspecified fines.,NTUH has not disclosed if the organ recipients have tested positive for HIV. But health experts say it's likely they will be infected and it will complicate their treatment.

,

,

,
,


,
The most popular contraceptive for women in eastern and southern Africa, a hormone shot given every three months, appears to double the risk that the women will be infected with HIV, according to a study published Monday. And when used by HIV-positive women, their male partners are twice as likely to get infected than if the women had used no contraception. ,The findings present an alarming quandary for African women. Hundreds of thousands suffer injuries, bleeding, infections and even death in childbirth from unintended pregnancies. Finding convenient contraceptives is a pressing goal for health authorities.,Injectable hormones are very popular. About 12 million women between the ages of 15 and 49 in sub-Saharan Africa, roughly 6 per cent of all women in that age group, use them. In the US, it is 1.2 million, or 3 per cent of women using contraception. While the study involved only African women, scientists said biological effects would probably be the same for all women. But concern was greatest in Africa because the risk of HIV transmission from heterosexual sex was so much higher there than elsewhere.,""The best contraception today is injectable hormonal contraception because you don't need a doctor, it's long-lasting, it enables women to control timing and spacing of birth without fuss and travel,"" said Isobel Coleman, director of the women and foreign policy program at Council on Foreign Relations. ""If it's now proven that these are helping spread the AIDS epidemic, we have a major health crisis on our hands."",The manufacturer of the branded version of the injectable, Depo-Provera, is Pfizer, which declined to comment on the study. ,

British police today appealed to women who may have had a relationship with a ""reckless"" HIV carrier to contact them immediately after he was jailed for passing on the deadly virus.,Simon McClure, 38, from Middlesbrough, was imprisoned after he admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm on a victim, with whom he had unprotected sex.,""If anybody has any information in relation to McClure they should come forward,"" Detective Inspector Andy Greenwood of Cleveland Police said.,""The possibility exists that he has had relationships with other people that we are not aware of and we would urge them to contact us immediately,"" Greenwood was quoted as saying by the BBC.,""The victim will suffer for the rest of her life through the reckless and callous behaviour of this individual,"" he said.,Earlier, Teesside Crown Court heard how a married McClure may have had sex with hundreds of women, including prostitutes.,His victim only found she was infected after becoming pregnant, the report said.,The court heard how McClure ignored clear advice from doctors not to have unprotected sex after he was diagnosed with the virus in 2006, following his return from Thailand.,His unsuspecting victim, identified in court only by her initials and who cannot be named for legal reasons, only found out she was infected when she went for blood tests after becoming pregnant, the report said.,Her baby was born prematurely the next day, but recent tests showed that the infant was not infected.

,

,

,
,


,
,,In the past year, three landmark clinical trials have shown that a daily dose of the antiretroviral medication Truvada can protect individuals from infection with HIV—a significant discovery, given the failure so far of all efforts to develop a vaccine against the virus.,Now researchers in San Francisco and Miami are planning to test this prevention strategy, called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, in a pilot study supported by the US National Institutes of Health. The researchers will soon recruit up to 500 uninfected men who have sex with men, especially those considered to be at greatest risk of infection, such as younger gay men and, in particular, African-Americans.,The men will be asked to take Truvada daily, and the researchers will monitor their compliance with the regimen, their sexual behaviour and their health status. Already, though, the prospect of antiretroviral drugs being used for prevention as well as treatment is raising complex questions. Will healthy uninfected people consistently take an expensive and powerful drug that can cause a range of side effects? Is it fair to provide medications to HIV-negative individuals when so many of those already infected do not have access? Will those receiving the drug be more likely to engage in risky sex because they believe they are protected—even if they do not always take it as prescribed?,The issues are more than academic: According to anecdotal reports, some doctors are already prescribing the medications to some HIV-negative patients, said Dr Kenneth Mayer, a chairman of the Fenway Institute, a research and advocacy centre for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender health in Boston, who has been involved in research into PrEP.,The Food and Drug Administration could soon approve Truvada for use in HIV prevention as well as treatment, which would undoubtedly lead to greater use of the drug. Gilead Sciences, the company that makes the drug, has said it is likely to file an application with the FDA early next year. Once the FDA approves a drug for any use, doctors can legally prescribe it ""off-label"" for other purposes. ,In one of the three earlier clinical trials, among men who have sex with men, PrEP reduced new infections by 44 per cent overall. Among men who adhered closely to the prescribed daily regimen, however, protection against infection was greater than 90 per cent.,Truvada combines two antiretroviral drugs, Viread and Emtriva, both also made by Gilead. Besides the upcoming study in the US, results from additional research into the use of Truvada as HIV prevention are expected over the next few years. The drug currently costs thousands of dollars a year.

As a National AIDS Control Organisation team visiting Junagadh Civil Hospital was winding up last week's probe into how 23 children with thalassaemia had contracted HIV, the father of one child was a few steps away. Yet he was too busy and too tired to care about the cause any longer, all his efforts now concentrated on the treatment of his four-month-old daughter.,""For two months, I did move from pillar to post to find out how my daughter had contracted HIV,"" said Salim Sheikh, 32, who went to Gandhinagar three times in 20 days to take up the matter of the 23 children.,""Now my girl's health is failing and she needs my complete attention. Teams will come and go. But my daughter has a fever and her blood transfusion too is due. I need to take her to a doctor,"" said Sheikh, who runs a tea stall right outside the hospital but who showed no interest in what the probe team was doing, even when it called him.,The parents of many of the 23 children, who tested HIV-positive between January and August, failed to meet the team. Barely educated and struggling to make ends meet, most live in villages across Junagadh district and had registered their children with the hospital, the closest and the most affordable facility for the blood transfusions that are needed periodically. ,""We cannot afford to travel to Junagadh so frequently. That costs us almost a day's meal. I would rather save it for my son's medical bills,"" said a daily wager from Vanthli whose son has tested HIV-positive and who now fears that this will threaten his younger daughter's future.,Junagadh policeman Shailesh Balash is among the few who remain vocal about the need to unearth the truth. ""So far the state health department itself investigated the matter. We hope the outside agency will bring out the truth,"" said Balash, whose HIV-positive son is 10.,The Gujarat government's response had upset many parents, who tried to meet the chief minister but failed. It took a month for the state heath department to transfer four employees of the hospital's blood bank out of the district, and even this was described as routine. Seven laboratory technicians were dismissed only the day before the arrival of the NACO team, with local authorities saying the termination orders came from Gandhinagar.,The revelation about the HIV infection came after Salim Sheikh had approached Salim Gujarati, a volunteer who helps out at the hospital and who, along with a new doctor, brought out the records.,The infection had been detected in January when a doctor decided to carry out HIV tests on all thalassaemic children registered in the ward. ""From January to August, 23 children tested positive,"" said Gujarati. ""But for the support of some staff members, we could not have brought the matter out in the open."",Once the matter became public, civil surgeon Dr B T Dayalu gave out various versions. From 33 in the morning, the number of HIV-positive children was brought down to 23. By evening, Health Minister Jaynararan Vyas confirmed 23 infected children but said they had been infected ""prior to admission to the government hospital."" The authorities had given the hospital a clean chit, stunning parents.,The state probe began on September 11, with a three-member team led by regional deputy director Dr Sunil Awasia and helped by the Gujarat State AIDS Control Society. That report is yet to be made public.,Parents who tried to meet Chief Minister Narendra Modi in Ahmedabad on September 18, the second day of his Sadbhavana Mission fast, were sent back by security personnel. The police gave them forced escort all the way back to Junagadh. Last week, parents met Governor Dr Kamla Beniwal, the meeting having been arranged by the Congress.,The Congress has demanded Rs 5 lakh as government compensation and raised Rs 23 lakh, the funds including Rs 23,000 per child from the party-run Junagadh Municipal Corporation. ""More than compensation, the truth should come out, the guilty should be punished,"" said Balash.,,Salim Sheikh played a key role in exposing the mass infection; he had approached a volunteer, who then took a doctor's help to come out with records. Today, Sheikh no longer has the time or the energy to look for reasons. Occupied in the treatment of his HIV-positive, eight-month-old daughter, he has shown no interest in a probe by a national team though he was called for his version.,Rasik Ranava, a daily wager of Junagadh city, who lost his elder son to thalassaemia five years ago, is struggling to afford the treatment of the younger son, not only thalassaemic but HIV-positive too. He earns Rs 250 a day. ""Blood transfusion is free but drugs and other expenses come to Rs 2000 to 3,000. I think I will need to work more to meet the expenses of the new disease,"" he said.,Jivu Jaffar's son, 5, and daughter, 4, tested HIV-positive in March and July. Her husband, a factory worker, needs at least two days' leave every week. ""They have so many complications that we need to keep seeing the doctor,"" Jivu said. She works as a domestic help but some employers grumble about her absence, she said, wishing she could spend more time with the children.,Shailesh Balash's son has lived on transfusions for nine of his 10 years. A constable with the Junagarh police, Balash said, ""I can challenge the claim that the children were affected before registration with JCH. I have all the records, but there's hardly anyone to listen."" He cautioned the government against a cover-up, saying that unless the mistake is rectified, other lives could be at stake.

Starting this November, city suburbs will be better equipped to handle HIV cases as three new Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centres will be open to the public. The ART centres will be located at Siddhartha Hospital (Goregaon), Shatabdi Hospital (Chembur) and MT Agarwal Hospital (Mulund). The plan to set up the ART centres was chalked out last year in order to relieve the overburdened centres of the south Mumbai hospitals.,""Many of the HIV patients who come to the existing ART centres for treatment are from the suburbs. The three new centres have been located in such a way that patients don't have to travel all the way to south Mumbai for treatment,"" said Harish Pathak, additional project manager of Maharashtra District AIDS Control Society (MDACS). ""The waiting period for patients will be reduced and it will also be possible to provide treatment more systematically. Both registered as well as fresh patients will now be shifted to the ART centre close to their residence,"" he added.,Currently, there are seven ART centres in the city, located at KEM Hospital (Parel), JJ Hospital (Byculla ), Sion Hospital, Nair Hospital (Mumbai Central), Godrej Memorial Hospital (Vikhroli) and Wadia Hospital (Parel). Sion Hospital also has a specialised paediatric ART centre. ,""As per the rules laid down by National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), 2,500 patients per ART centre is the threshold limit. However, JJ Hospital has around 7,000 registered patients and KEM has more than 5,000 patients. If the three new ART centres prove to be a success, we will definitely plan more centres in coming years,"" said Pathak. ,Dr S S Kudalkar, project director of MDACS, has already spoken to medical superintendents of the hospitals to discuss the logistics. ,""The centre has already been set up and trained staff with expertise have been recruited specifically to handle the ART centre,"" said Dr S Poikar, medical superintendent of Siddhartha Hospital in Goregaon. ,According to MDACS, there are currently 17,700 adults and 1,119 children living on ART care in the city.

""Their self-esteem was so low. It did not matter (to them) whether they lived or died,"" says Parinita Bhattacharjee, director of the Karnataka Health Promotion Trust. She was describing the attitude of sex works until an initiative helped mobilise them and ended up lowering incidence of HIV.,""The effort was to mobilise them, understand their issues and grievances and help find a solution,"" says Bhattacharjee, and citing the result: HIV prevalence among sex workers has declined from 25 to 14 per cent since 2005-06.,Karnataka, along with other governments, has been working on intervention programmes in collaboration with Avahan, an initiative launched in India with funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.,Prof Lalit Dandona, researcher at Public Health Foundation of India, New Delhi, told The Indian Express large-scale interventions by Avahan alone have helped prevent over a lakh infections between 2003 and 2008, an assessment published online in The Lancet on Tuesday.,It is based on a statistical analysis of trends and current data among high-risk individuals inkey areas, researchers say. ""We created a counter-factual model — 'What if Avahan had not been there?' — and that's how we arrived at the estimation,"" Dandona said.,In Karnataka, the project every month sees over 22,000 people treated at clinics and nearly four million condoms distributed. ,In Mumbai, a sex worker says she knows she could any day face a stubborn client refusing to use a condom, or even a violent one. Yet in any crisis, she knows, she is assured of help in minutes. Since a violence response programme was set up under Avahan, Mumbai has seen a 38 per cent decline in crisis incidents between 2007 and 2009 , and Andhra Pradesh a 30 per cent drop between 2006 and 2008.,Avahan was launched in 2003, in six states with a high HIV burden. It received $258 million from the Gates Foundation until 2008; an additional $80 million was announced in 2009 to support the transition of this initiative to merge with the government's HIV control effort by 2013.,""We work in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Nagaland, and Manipur. Within those states, our partners serve 75 districts — each with a population of about 2 million people — and around 630 towns. Avahan also works along 8,000 km of national highways"" to reach truckers, says Alkesh Wadhwani, head of Avahan India. ,Avahan's partners include local and international NGOs, universities, and research organisations. Nine lead partners at state level support local a number of NGOs that implement the strategy.,In Andhra, S V Shreeram the director of programmes at India-HIV Alliance, an Avahan partner, cited 90 intervention programmes. ""Today we have covered 45,000 sex workers and men having sex with men."",In Maharashtra, interventions by Avahan were implemented through Pathfinder International and Family Health International. Darshana Vyas, programme director of Pathfinder in Mumbai, said, ""By 2009 on a monthly basis the programme was meeting more than 39,000 sex workers and distributing approximately two million condoms and servicing over 20,000 visits. Over two million condoms were sold monthly to high-risk men."",""There were sex workers from various cities who barely spoke to each other. We had to get them on a common platform,"" said Sanjeevsingh Gaikwad, director of Family Health International in Mumbai. After the Aastha programme, ""groups collectively came to the aid of any sex worker who complained that the client refused to use a condom"".,National AIDS Control Organisation programme manager Mani Lal gave a picture of the overall reach of combined efforts — 1,600 NGOs, 8.62 lakh female sex workers, 4.24 men-having-sex-with-men and 1.8 intravenous drug users.  ""NACO spends Rs 250 crore on targeted interventions,"" Lal said.,Dr Dileep Deshmukh, joint director of the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society, said the prevalence rate of HIV has shot down from 1.1 per cent in 2005 to 0.3 per cent in 2010 among antenatal women.

A six-member team from the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), which came to Junagadh on Wednesday to investigate the incident wherein 23 thalassemic children contracted HIV allegedly during blood transfusion at the Civil Hospital, has kept the local authorities at bay.,The team arrived here on a three-day inspection visit from Delhi last evening, a month after the state health department team had visited the hospital and collected data. ,On Thursday, NACO officials, who remained tight lipped about the inquiry, locked themselves inside the hospital blood bank to conduct investigation. They have kept the hospital staffers, including top officials, completely out of probe. Their assistance has not been sought even to scan and locate the files related to the incident. They also refused to speak to mediapersons and local politicians.,The team has come close on the heels of termination of service contract of seven employees and transfer of four employees by the health department. A day after the incident came to light in September, the state government gave a clean chit to hospital, claiming the affected children had contracted the deadly virus prior to their registration with the hospital.

UNAIDS's World AIDS Day report for 2011, which was released on Monday, revealed a dramatic decrease of 56 per cent between 1996 and 2010 in the number of new HIV infections in India. South and South East Asia with an estimated 2,70,000 new HIV cases in 2010 showed a 40 per cent reduction but India's figure is significant as it is the country with the largest HIV load in the region. Worldwide, with 2.7 million new HIV infections in 2010, the number of new infections went down by 21 per cent compared to 1997. ,Incidentally, the report points out, the rate of HIV prevalence is lower in Asia than in some other regions but the absolute size of the population means it is the second largest group of people living with HIV. Sub-Saharan Africa continues to be the region most heavily affected by HIV in 2010 with 70 per cent of the new infections being reported from the region. The number is 26 per cent less than at the height of the epidemic in 2007. An estimated 5.6 million people are believed to be living with HIV in South Africa alone. ,The report highlighted the burgeoning HIV load of countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia where there was a 250 per cent increase between 2001 and 2010 in people living with HIV and the fact that the HIV epidemic in North America and Western and Central Europe remains ""stubbornly steady"". The total number of people living with HIV in the region was 34 per cent more than the figure in 2001. More than half of the total 2.2 million HIV positive people in the area are from the US. ,Commenting on India's success in restricting the epidemic, Sayan Chatterjee, secretary, National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), said: ""It gives us great satisfaction to see India's efforts in the area of prevention bearing fruit and our programmes being lauded by international organisations. It is the whole bouquet of measures that we have put in place, including programmes for care, support and treatment that have ensured this."" ,Behaviour change among young people, sex workers, injectible drug users and MSM groups is the biggest reason for the fall in new HIV infections, the report pointed out.,Increased coverage of anti-retroviral therapy programmes was pronounced as the key to universal access to treatment, care and support. ,According to UNAIDS and WHO estimates, 47 per cent (6.6 million) of the estimated 14.2 million people eligible for treatment in low and middle income countries were accessing lifesaving ART in 2010 — a rise of 1.35 million since 2009. Around 400,000 new HIV infections in children are estimated to have been averted since 1995 due to increased access to effective ART regimens.

India, which has one of the highest populations of HIV-infected people in Asia, has witnessed a decline in new infections by a significant 56 per cent from the epidemic's peak in 1996, with other Asian countries also showing a plunge.,According to the UNAIDS World Aids Day report 2011, the number of new HIV infections has been falling significantly in Asia, with India leading the pack.,It said new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths have fallen by 21 per cent from the peak of the epidemic around world.,The number of people dying of AIDS-related causes fell to 1.8 million in 2010, down from a peak of 2.2 million in the mid-2000s, while a total of 2.5 million deaths have been averted in low- and middle-income countries since 1995 due to antiretroviral therapy being introduced.,""In South and South-East Asia, the estimated 270,000 new HIV infections in 2010 was 40 per cent less than at the epidemic's peak in 1996,"" said the report.,""In India, the country with the largest number of people living with HIV in the region, new HIV infections fell by 56 per cent,"" it added.,Releasing the report here, Executive Director of UNAIDS Michel Sidibe said the results are satisfactory, but stressed that shared responsibility is needed to combat the epidemic more effectively.,""Even in a very difficult financial crisis, countries are delivering results in the AIDS response. We have seen a massive scale up in access to HIV treatment which has had a dramatic effect on the lives of people everywhere,"" Sidibe said in a release. ,The report put the total number of people living with HIV in the world at present at around 34 million, a rise from 32.9 million a year ago.,According to the report, the number of new HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa has dropped by more than 26 per cent from the height of the epidemic in 1997, led by a one third drop in South Africa, the country with the largest number of new HIV infections in the world.,In the Caribbean, new HIV infections were reduced by a third from 2001 levels and by more than 25 per cent in Dominican Republic and Jamaica.,However, the number of new HIV infections continues to rise in Central Asia and Eastern Europe, Oceania and Middle-East, and North Africa, while it has remained stable in other regions of the world.,""Declines in new HIV infections are also being spurred by changes in sexual behaviour, particularly in young people, as people reduce their numbers of sexual partners, increase condom use and are waiting longer before becoming sexually active,"" the report said.,""HIV prevalence declined among young people in at least 21 of 24 countries with national HIV prevalence of one per cent or higher. Five additional countries, Burkina Faso, Congo, Ghana, Nigeria, and Togo have seen HIV prevalence decline by more than 25 per cent between 2001 and 2010 in young people,"" it added.

Australian researchers are claiming to have made a significant breakthrough which will help men with HIV to have children through artificial insemination, without infecting their partners and babies.,Doctors of Royal Womens' Hospital in Victoria have developed a programme where men with HIV have the virus eliminated from sperm samples before insemination.,According to ABC report, the researcher Michelle Giles said the programme is about helping couples get pregnant safely.,""Many of these couples want to be the biological parent of a child and have a family,"" she said adding, ""So because of this we want to be able to offer them a treatment that is as safe as possible.,""Giles said it is the first programme of its kind in Australia.,""We process the male's semen, so we minimise the chance of there being HIV in that semen, and then use it to try and get the woman pregnant,"" she said.,""By doing that, we're trying to prevent her getting HIV at all, and if we can prevent her being infected with HIV, then we can prevent the future child from being infected with HIV.""

More people than ever are living with the AIDS virus but this is largely due to better access to drugs that keep HIV patients alive and well for many years, the United Nations AIDS programme (UNAIDS) said on Monday.,In its annual report on the pandemic, UNAIDS said the number of people dying of the disease fell to 1.8 million in 2010, down from a peak of 2.2 million in the mid-2000s.,UNAIDS director Michel Sidibe said the past 12 months had been a game-changing year in the global AIDS fight.,Some 2.5 million deaths have been averted in poor and middle-income countries since 1995 due to AIDS drugs being introduced and access to them improving, according to UNAIDS.,Much of that success has come in the past two years as the numbers of people getting treatment has increased rapidly.,We've never had a year when there has been so much science, so much leadership and such results in one year, Sidibe said in a telephone interview from UNAIDS headquarters in Geneva.,Even in this time of public finance crises and uncertainty about funding, we're seeing results. We are seeing more countries than ever before (achieving) significant reductions in new infections and stabilising their epidemics.,Since the beginning of the AIDS pandemic in the 1980s, more than 60 million people have been infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS. HIV can be controlled for many years with cocktails of drugs, but there is as yet no cure.,TREATMENT FOR PREVENTION,The UNAIDS report said 34 million people around the world had HIV in 2010, up from 33.3 million in 2009.,Among the most dramatic changes was the leap in the number of people getting treatment with AIDS drugs when they need it., Of the 14.2 million people eligible for treatment in low- and middle-income countries, around 6.6 million, or 47 percent, are now receiving it, UNAIDS said, and 11 poor- and mid-income countries now have universal access to HIV treatment, with coverage of 80 percent or more.,This compares with 36 percent of the 15 million people needing treatment in 2009 who got AIDS drugs.,Major producers of HIV drugs include Gilead, Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck, Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline. Improved access to drugs from these and other manufacturers means not only that fewer people are dying of AIDS each year, UNAIDS said, but also that the risk of new HIV infections is reduced.,A series of scientific studies have shown that getting timely treatment to those with HIV can substantially cut the number of people who become newly infected with the virus.,  Sidibe said this was starting to show in new case numbers., There were 2.7 million new HIV infections worldwide in 2010, 15 percent fewer than in 2001, and 21 percent below the number of new infections at the peak of the epidemic in 1997.,The big point for us is the number of new infections --that's where you win against the epidemic, Sidibe said., Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said the growing number of averted AIDS deaths was important progress, but said the number of people on treatment needed to increase dramatically to reap the benefits of science showing treatment saves lives and prevents new infections.,Never, in more than a decade of treating people living with HIV/AIDS, have we been at such a promising moment to really turn this epidemic around, said MSF's Tido von Schoen-Angerer.,Governments in some of the hardest hit countries want to act on the science, seize this moment and reverse the AIDS epidemic. But this means nothing if there is no money to make it happen.,Despite progress on HIV treatment and prevention, sub-Saharan Africa is still by far the worst hit, accounting for 68 percent of all those living with HIV in 2010 despite its population accounting for only 12 percent of the global total.,Around 70 percent of new HIV infections in 2010, and almost half of all AIDS-related deaths, were in sub-Saharan Africa., Sidibe said with many international donor countries struggling with slow economic growth and high debt, the global AIDS fight had to become even more focused on high impact interventions to deliver progress in the places worst hit.,We need to maintain our investment, but ... in a smarter way. Then we'll see a serious decline in the epidemic, he said.,,Here is the latest global and regional picture on HIV and AIDS from a report by the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) released on Monday.,THE GLOBAL PICTURE:,* An estimated 34 million people worldwide had the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS in 2010, according to the latest UNAIDS data. This number is up 17 percent on 2001, when 28.6 million were living with HIV.,* There were 2.7 million new HIV infections in 2010, including an estimated 390,000 among children.,* The proportion of women with HIV remained stable in 2010 at 50 percent of all those with the virus, but in sub-Saharan Africa, women account for 59 percent of people living with HIV.,* An estimated 1.8 million people died of AIDS-related causes in 2010.,,REGIONAL BREAKDOWN,AFRICA:,* Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region hardest hit by HIV, with 22.9 million HIV-positive people in 2010 -- about 68 percent of the global total.,* The number of new HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa has dropped by more than 26 percent, to 1.9 million in 2010, down from an estimated 2.6 million in 1997., * South Africa has more people with HIV than any other country in the world -- an estimated 5.6 million cases., * There were 1.2 million AIDS-related deaths in sub-Saharan Africa in 2010.,* AIDS has killed at least a million people each year in the region since 1998., ASIA:,* Although rates of HIV are lower in Asia than in some other regions, the size of the Asian population means it has the second largest group of people living with HIV.,* There are 4 million people living with HIV in South and South East Asia, and there were 270,000 new infections in the region and 250,000 AIDS-related deaths in 2010,,* Since the epidemic's peak in 1996, there has been a 40 percent decline in new HIV infections in this region.,* In East Asia, 790,000 people have HIV. There were 56,000 AIDS related deaths in 2010. In this region, there has been an increase in new HIV infections to 88,000 in 2010 from 74,000 in 2001., EASTERN EUROPE & CENTRAL ASIA:,* Since 2001, the number of people living with HIV in this region has increased to 1.5 million in 2010 from 410,000 in 2001.,* Russia and Ukraine account for nearly 90 percent of the regional epidemic.,* In 2010, an estimated 90,000 adults and children died of AIDS, up from 7,800 in 2001. Injecting drug use remains the leading cause of HIV infection in this region.,MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA:,* There are 470,000 adults and children with HIV in 2010 in this region, up from 320,000 in 2001. New infections also rose to 59,000 in 2010 from 43,000 in 2001, and deaths from AIDS increased to 35,000 in 2010 from 22,000 in 2001.,SOURCES: UNAIDS

A multi-centric study involving city-based National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) has showed 96 per cent efficacy of the use of early anti-retroviral therapy (ART) for preventing HIV transmission to uninfected sexual partner.,It also protects the infected person from Extra Pulmonary TB apart from giving other clinical benefits.,Issues like will anti-retroviral treatment of the HIV positive partner reduce the rate of transmission to the negative partner and can an immediate therapy slow the progression of disease as compared to delayed therapy were among the questions researchers across nine countries worked on since five years.,In India, 175 couples from NARI and 250 from Chennai-based YRG Care organisation were involved. The trial included 1,763 couples out of which 886 couples were randomly assigned to the early-therapy group and 877 to the delayed-therapy group. Twelve additional HIV-uninfected partners were enrolled as the result of a new relationship. A majority of couples (97%) were heterosexual, 94% were married and 50% of HIV-infected participants were men. ,Findings of the study were recently published in New England Journal of Medicine and stated that early treatment benefits both infected and uninfected persons. NARI director Dr R S Paranjape said only 39 uninfected partners got the HIV infection. Out of this, it was proved by the study, 28 infections were acquired from their partners. While one transmission of HIV case occurred in the early therapy group, 27 occurred in the delayed therapy group of sero discordant couples, resulting in a 96 per cent reduction in the rate of transmission. ,NARI scientist Dr Sheela Godbole who was the investigator of records for the study in Pune, said not a single person got infected in the NARI study which was part of the the trial conducted at 13 sites in nine countries. Of the 27 transmissions, nine were man-to-woman, 18 were woman-to-man and all occurred when the infected partner was not receiving anti-retroviral therapy.,For many years, anti retroviral therapy was delayed until a patient's CD4 count fell below 200 cells per cubic millimeter, which led to frequent opportunistic infections. The Indian government guidelines have raised the bar to starting ART for an HIV positive person with a CD 4 count of 350.,However, this study shows that patients with HIV infection who had CD4 counts between 350 and 550 cells per cubic millimeter and who were in a stable sexual relationship with an uninfected partner benefited from early ART.

For HIV positive couple Vijay Bhende and Sangeeta who will celebrate their third anniversary this World AIDS Day (December 1) by getting more couples together, it is all about having a healthy regimen to stay fit and combat the disease. Vijay, who is on second line drugs, has been on medication since 2000 while his wife has completed a year's treatment. ""Our marriage is also a success due to consistent adherence to treatment,"" says Vijay.,""Initially I had sought treatment from private practitioners in 2000 and later shifted to the government facility as they started distributing the drugs free of cost,"" says Vijay, who works with the Network of People living with HIV in Maharashtra. ""For ten years I have been on Anti Retroviral Treatment (ART) and am living happily,"" says Vijay.,Increasing use of ART has not just increased the life span, but also helped HIV positive people improve their quality of life.  At Sassoon General Hospital, there are 5,358 people on ART. ""We have shifted some 3,000 people to the ART centre run by the National AIDS Research Institute,"" Dr D B Kadam, in charge of the ART centre, says. A total of 156 people who have failed to respond to first line of treatment no longer have to travel to J J Hospital in Mumbai as Sassoon has started giving second line drugs.,The second line facility was introduced in Pune, Aurangabad and Nagpur recently. ""We go through patients' records to check whether they are eligible for second line treatment. Not only do we check the CD4 count to test viral load in the body but liver and kidney function tests are also conducted before placing them on second line treatment. Meanwhile, a total of 24,214 people are also eligible for ART and have registered at the ART centre.,NARI's centre at Gokhalenagar has over 2000 patients on its rolls. ""We have also set up the facility for laboratory investigations including sonography machines to rule out problems like abdominal tuberculosis and others,"" says scientist Dr Manisha Ghate, in charge of the NARI ART centre.,At the ART centre at YCMH in Pimpri-Chinchwad, a total of 4,240 people are presently on free treatment. The number of people eligible for ART, however, is increasing and a total number of 6,081 applications are pending, says Dr Nitin Gaikwad, in charge of the YCMH ART centre.,""Every month we have one or two persons who prove resistant to the drugs and have to be placed on second line treatment. What has happened is that lifespan of people has increased by 10-12 years,"" says Gaikwad. There is a perceptible decrease in number of new cases of HIV, says Dr Sanjay Pujari, a private consultant.

Teenagers in Asia receiving treatment for HIV are showing early signs of osteoporosis and children as young as five are becoming resistant to AIDS drugs, an anti-AIDS group said on Thursday, urging more attention be given to young HIV patients.,The finding, made available on World AIDS Day, is a reminder that while more people in Asia now have access to basic AIDS drugs, improved medicines remain out of reach and patients — both adults and children — still suffer from inadequate care.,In Asia, some 160,000 children are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS. Of these, 57,000 require treatment but only 30,000 were receiving them as of the end of 2008, according to UNICEF.,Researchers at TREAT Asia found children as young as five were developing resistance to AIDS drugs and may soon require improved, more expensive medicines, which are not available for them yet.,""In our cohort, about 14 per cent of the children have failed first-line drugs... Some of the children who are already on second-line are under the age of five,"" Annette Sohn, director of TREAT Asia, told Reuters.,Poor adherence to the timing or frequency of taking AIDS drugs results in resistance. But in Asia, resistance is also due to the lack of drug formulations for children.,""We all made some mistakes on how we managed patients with HIV in the beginning of the epidemic,"" Sohn said. ""We used adult tablets, we had no paediatric formulations in our countries."",Sohn said health experts and drug providers need to find ways to make third-line, more powerful drugs available for children in poor countries. Such medications are available or subsidised in rich nations but very expensive and sometimes unavailable in developing countries.,A long-term study of 4,000 HIV patients under the age of 23 in Asia by TREAT Asia also showed that a high percentage of teenagers had low bone mineral density, a precursor of osteoporosis.,""We did a special X-ray on these teenagers who are about 16 years old and found that 15 per cent of them had low bone mass,"" Sohn said.,""That is not normal. Kids are not supposed to have low bone mass when they're 16 years old and that's because of the effect of HIV on their bodies... brain, bone, immune system."",Sohn, a paediatric specialist for children with HIV/AIDS,  said this may also be due to toxic effects that some AIDS drugs, such as tenofovir, have on bone.,The study covers Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia and India. TREAT Asia is a network of clinics, hospitals and research institutions working together to improve access to treatment for AIDS.

,
The HIV prevalence among female sex workers in Budhwar Peth has registered a significant decrease — from 41.2 per cent in 2008 to 13 per cent this year. The transition has been brought about by empowering sex workers under the HIV/AIDS programme run by Pathfinder International and supported by the Avahan India AIDS Initiative of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, said T K Jayarajan, Technical Specialist (Documentation) Pathfinder.,Jayarajan told Newsline that ever since interventions were launched in Pune in 2009, analysis of HIV prevalence data among ante-natal clinic attendees shows that there is a significant decline. Approximately 3,000 female sex workers reside in Budhwar Peth and Pathfinder International's Mukta project provided the necessary impetus for a cohesive action.,The HIV Sentinel Surveillance data of 2008 showed HIV prevalence at 41.2 per cent and Pathfinder's programme data shows the prevalence at 13 per cent this year. A fact that is also supported by Ramesh Deokar, Project Director of Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS).,There are approximately 96,000 female sex workers across the state and 164 MSACS projects are providing interventions in the form of condoms, HIV awareness and prevention. Among female sex workers, the HIV prevalence is 7-8 per cent, said Deokar.,""We support 64 NGOs at a cost of Rs 13.50 crore per year for upscaling HIV intervention programmes. We will be taking over 32 projects and each project will get a grant of Rs 15 lakh from the National AIDS Control Organisation,"" said Deokar. Such has been the impact of the Mukta project that a community learning centre set up at Budhwar Peth provided an impetus to female sex workers to form their own 12-member core committee.,Pathfinder project director Darshana Vyas said MSACS has recognised the community learning centre in Budhwar Peth as a 'learning site' where training programmes are offered to high-risk group members.,According to president of the committee Meenakshi, today sex workers regularly meet at the learning centre, discuss issues relevant to their profession and even interact with ward officers to get the garbage cleared and help improve erratic power supply at Sagar building. The centre now has strated a beauty parlour and stitching courses to empower sex workers.

,
An HIV positive patient has slapped a notice on GTB Hospital alleging that her treating doctors put up a chart ""resembling a placard"", which stated ""Seropositive-BioHazard"", against her bed during the three days she was admitted to the hospital. ,The patient, who is registered at the Hospital's Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centre, reported to the emergency on July 19, with complaint of back and abdominal pain. She was later admitted to the surgery ward till July 22. ,Speaking to Newsline, the patient's lawyer Ambalika Roy said, ""My client was humiliated by the doctors. She herself disclosed her HIV status in the emergency, in a responsible manner. The hospital, on its part, behaved completely irresponsibly, putting up this chart near the head of her bed, stating her HIV status in bold letters for the world to see."" ,Terming this act as a ""humongous breach of her (patient's) confidentiality"", in the notice, accessed by Newsline, Roy has demanded action against the persons responsible. The notice further alleges that when the patient complained about the chart, doctors told her that it was important for their safety.,Though the hospital is yet to formally reply to this notice, preliminary inquiries have established that the notice was put up to ensure that treating doctors are cautious in case of needle pricks. ,According to medical superintendent Dr Rajpal, ""We did not use phrases like HIV or AIDS, which the common public can understand. A technical term (Seropositive) was used and the patient was given complete treatment. She has also been operated on in our hospital earlier, so there is no question of discrimination."" ,Asked if this was a routine practice for the hospital, Dr Rajpal said for all patients reporting with ""infectious diseases"", isolation facilities are maintained in the hospital. ""We have a separate dialysis machine to avoid risk of blood-to-blood transmissions, but no such charts are usually put up,"" he said. ,The patient was operated on by the same doctor for rectovaginal fistula earlier.,An instruction issued by National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) in August 2010 to state AIDS control societies and ART centres, specifically directs healthcare providers to ensure that the HIV status of a patient is not disclosed publicly. ,Doctors, however, claim there is little awareness about the rules and the protocol to be followed in hospitals while treating HIV patients. ""It sounds outrageous to imagine that doctors may be putting up such notices, but whether we like it or not, doctors and nurses need to be cautious and take necessary precautions like a prophylaxis course, in case of pin pricks from an HIV patient, while administering treatment,"" a senior NACO official said. ,""While the guidelines are there, there needs to be more awareness among the medical community in this regard, and hospital administrations should take a more proactive role,"" the official said.

,

,

,
,


,
In order to reduce the infant mortality rate due to HIV transmission from mother to child, the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) has kicked off a programme —Early Infant Diagnosis (EID) — in the state. As per the EID programme, children of HIV positive mothers will be screened six weeks after their birth. ,""Earlier, the children would be tested for the virus only after 18 months of their birth. Mother-to-child transmission continues to be a problem area in preventing spread of HIV and an early diagnosis will help us to provide treatment at the right time,"" said Dr Asha Hegde, consultant, MSACS.,Hegde added 33 per cent of HIV infant deaths happen within the first year of infection and 50 per cent in the second year. Currently, MSACS has registered 203 babies on antiretroviral treatment (ART) in the state. ,According to the EID programme, a spot blood test of the child will be screened. If tested positive, a whole blood sample will be sent for further analysis. ""Children who test positive early will be treated early and as a result, we can reduce the mortality rate. The HIV positive woman will be monitored and after delivery, will be sent with her child to the EID diagnosis centre for the tests,"" Hegde said.,While state recorded figures have shown an overall dip in the number of fresh HIV cases this year, doctors feel mother-to-child transmission continues to be a source of worry and early diagnosis might help the situation.  ,""Children are asymptomatic below the age of 18 months. However, by that time, if the child is HIV positive, there could be possible damage done to brain development. Early detection as well as prophylactic treatment is extremely important in the case of HIV positive mothers,"" said Dr Mamta Manglani, head of pediatrics at Sion Hospital. ,A recent NACO report revealed that India has around 40,000 pregnant women who are HIV positive and 12,000 HIV infected children are born each year. Transmission of the virus from the mother to the child was said to be as high as 30 per cent.

Five years ago, HIV was one of the 20 top causes of death in the armed forces, seventh leading cause of death in the Army and the second most prevalent reason of death in the Navy. ,Today, according to the the Director General of Armed Forces Medical Services (DGAFMS), there are barely 0.017 per cent HIV positive personnel in the 12-lakh strong armed forces, with no deaths registered last year. Serving soldiers with HIV are no longer invalidated from service, it said.,While HIV infection is on the decline in the country, the efforts by the armed forces to combat the infection have proved successful to the extent that the HIV detection rate is now a miniscule 0.007 to 0.017 per cent in the serving population. ,The prevalence rate of HIV in the armed forces is approximately 40 times less than the national prevalence. At present, the adult HIV prevalence in the country is 0.31 per cent. ,According to top officials at the DGAFMS, the number of HIV cases — at less than 240 now — are half of what it was in 2004. The armed forces had reported 461 cases of HIV /AIDS in 2005 and 475 in 2004. A need-based HIV-AIDS control programme is being implemented in the armed forces with the latest revision in the policy being done last year. ,The armed forces witnessed the spread of the disease in three phases — the first phase from 1991 to 1998, second from 1999 to 2003, and third phase from 2004 onwards. ,The period from 1999- 2001 witnessed a sharp increase in the infection detected among the voluntary blood donors initially from 0.34 per cent to 1.3 per cent and then declined from 2002 onwards. ,Action was immediately taken when the first-ever case of infection was detected in a jawan who returned from the UN Mission in 1991. This led to the formation of the AIDS Control Organisation (ACO) at AFMC, Pune in 1992. ,The mode of contraction was mostly through sexual exposure and among the reasons for high prevalence were often the difficult service conditions.

Almost one-and-a-half years after 'Project Connect', the insurance scheme for HIV positive persons, was introduced in Mumbai, only 10 persons have been registered as benficiaries. Moreover, those who have been insured, have been complaining of delay in reimbursements.  ,""The medicine prescription that was given to me did not specify dosages. There was some discrepancy in the costs of the medicines too. I had to go back to the doctor and then to the pharmacy to get the correct documents,"" said a Chembur resident, who has been visiting a Ghatkopar hospital for treatment.,Introduced last year in Mumbai-Thane, the scheme is supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the insurance is being provided by Star Health and Allied Insurance. ,As per the scheme, the client will initially get a health cover of Rs 30,000 for which a premium of Rs 1,511 will have to be paid to the insurance company. The policy holder is entitled to pay only Rs 750 and the rest is subsidised by NGO Population Services of India (PSI). Half of the amount can be claimed at the onset of AIDS, and the rest for the treatment of other problems, like co-infections associated with HIV.,Officials say the delay in reimbursement is a result of inaccurate documents issued by hospitals. ""The insurance company sends back the claims wherever they find inadequate proof and claimants then have to run back to the doctors to clarify details,"" said a PSI officer. He added that often finer details of the procedure are ignored, as a result of which only around 10 persons from Mumbai have been registered as beneficiaries as part of the scheme.,Incidentally, sources have said that PSI's tie up with the project has ended which has added to the delay in reimbursements. ""PSI was a facilitator in the initiation of the scheme. Our project period ended in September and other NGOs will continue to be a medium between the insurance company and the claimant,"" said project director of PSI, Dr Shekhar Waikar.  ,According to the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS), Raigad, Pune and Latur don't have even a single person registered as a beneficiary. ,""The scheme was introduced in 25 districts of the state, excluding Mumbai and Thane. The districts in charge are responsible for helping the claimants to get their insurance. However, due to lack of manpower, many districts don't have an official in charge, as a result of which the scheme hasn't been able to reach out to  many districts yet,"" said an MSACS official.

Parents of the 23 thalassemic children from Junagadh, who were tested HIV+ after blood transfusion this year, have moved the Gujarat High Court with a demand to hand over investigation of their criminal complaints to an independent agency or an officer senior than a Superintendent of Police. ,In the petition, the parents have alleged that their criminal complaints in the matter have not been investigated by the district police either with malice intention or under influence of political leaders to safeguard the culprits. ,The petition, moved jointly by the parents through their advocate Deval Patel, is likely to be heard by a division bench of the HC, which is also hearing a public interest litigation in this connection.,The petition states, ""...due to gross negligence and in violation of regulatory requirements of blood and/or its components, including blood products, infected blood of HIV positive has been infused to the children/patients by the responsible doctors, staff of the (Junagadh Civil) hospital and the blood bank, without there being proper care and caution, knowing fully well that the said blood was to be used during the course of treatment of small and innocent children having dangerous disease like thalassemia."",After the detection of HIV infection, the parents of the 23 children had lodged written criminal complaints with the concerned police station. When the concerned police inspector allegedly did not act on the complaint, they lodged written complaints with the Junagadh SP. But even the SP did not act on the complaints without ""cogent reasons"", they alleged. Now they have no alternate legal remedy available than to approach the HC for the protection of their rights, the petitioners say. ,They have also stated that their complaints specifically disclosed the congnizable offence against the accused and the PI and the SP had the bounden duty and powers to register an FIR and get the complaints investigated.

The number of people living with HIV in the UK reached an estimated 91,500 in 2010, with a quarter of those unaware of their infection, according to official figures published on Tuesday.,The figures came from the Health Protection Agency (HPA) before the World AIDS Day on December 1.,The HPA has called for universal testing for HIV, so that no one leaves an STI (sexually transmitted infections) clinic without knowing their HIV status.,The HPA is concerned that over half of people diagnosed in 2010 came forward for testing after the point at which treatment for their infection should ideally have begun. ,Late diagnosis is associated with an increased risk of AIDS and death.,The HPA's annual 'HIV in the UK' report found 6,660 people were newly diagnosed with HIV in the UK.,The report confirmed that infections probably acquired within the UK almost doubled in the last decade from 1,950 in 2001 to 3,640 in 2010 and exceed those acquired abroad -- 3,020.,This rise is mostly due to infections acquired among men who have sex with men, who remain the group most at risk of HIV infection in the UK.,Dr Valerie Delpech, consultant epidemiologist and head of HIV surveillance at the HPA, said: ""HIV is an infection which can nowadays be treated and those diagnosed promptly can expect to experience similar life expectancy as an individual without the infection.,""However, we are very concerned that a large number of people in the UK are unaware of their HIV status and are diagnosed late"".

They have alleged that the government was not showing any urgency on the issue and appealed to it to pass the HIV/AIDS bill in the Winter Session.,A group of NGOs and Lawyers' Collective, a legal advocacy group that helped draft the HIV/AIDS bill, said the measure is very important in the light of the ""large-scale"" discrimination being faced by the HIV positive people in the country.,To create awareness about the HIV, Azad said the government will soon start 'Red Buses' on the lines of 'Red Trains' which will be used for campaign purposes. ""Wherever trains can't reach, we will use the buses,"" he said.,Addressing the function, Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit said the city government will provide Rs 1,600-2,000 financial assistance to HIV children as well as children whose parents were infected by it.

Two medical colleges in the city are preparing new guidelines for nutritional requirements of HIV patients in India, that will be implemented in AIDS treatment centres across the country from next year. The World Health Organisation and UNICEF-supported programme is being spearheaded by the the National AIDS Control Programme (NACO) under the 12th five-year plan. ,According to Dr B B Rewari, in-charge of Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) from NACO, ""We have identified nutrition to be one of the shortcomings of AIDS control programme, in the current plan. So, a working group was constituted last month to address this issue and we have already had a series of meetings on the matter."" ,Maulana Azad Medical College (MAMC) is designing the module for adult HIV patients, while Lady Hardinge Medical College (LHMC) is handling nutritional requirements of children. From early next year, staff across ART centres will be trained on these guidelines. ,Dr Richa Dewan, professor of medicine at MAMC and medical superintendent of Lok Nayak Hospital, who is one of the experts appointed by NACO for the program, said, ""HIV patients have compromised immune systems, which makes them susceptible to opportunistic infections. In such vulnerable conditions, malnutrition expedites the process of HIV infection, making AIDS more aggressive."" ,The side effects of the drugs used in the treatment of HIV, like fungal infections, mouth ulcers and sores, and infections in the food pipe need to be countered through nutrition. Staff at ART centres will be trained in assessment of the patient specific nutritional needs. ,""In HIV, there is no standard nutritional requirement for everybody, since patients react differently to the drugs, and contract different infections,"" Dr Dewan said. ,For children in particular, the diet needs to address the risk of his/her growth and development being stunted by the toxicity of the AIDS drugs. A recent study released on World AIDS day by NGO 'TREAT Asia' had found low bone density in over 15 per cent of HIV patients in Asia. ,According to Dr Revari, ""For the first time, for children, we have incorporated WHO guidelines for breast feeding for HIV positive mothers. While there is a risk of mother-to-child transmission of the infection through breast milk, replacement milk has been known to pose a bigger risk of diarrhoea, since poor households which cannot afford to prepare it properly, use cheap alternatives"". ,The guidelines have said that it was important to stick to either option, since mothers often tended to mix the two in their confusion, thus, doubling the risks. ,While some states have taken up nutrition counselling in their state AIDS control programs, only the ten centres of excellence for HIV under NACO, have addressed nutrition as a dimension of HIV so far.

While latest figures have shown a dip in the number of HIV cases in the city, doctors feel that mother-to-child transmission continues to be a problem area in the overall combat of the disease. ,A Maharashtra District AIDS Control Society (MDACS) report released over the weekend said that the number of cases registered for HIV reduced from 5420 in 2007 to 595 in 2011.The number of deaths also reduced to 15 (of 595) in 2011 from 223 (of 5,420) in 2007. MDACS has registered 595 cases in the first 10 months of 2011.,""Maharashtra has the highest number of institutional deliveries, yet the number of mother-to-child transmission cases is exceptionally high. This shows a clear lacuna in detection and treatment of HIV infected mothers,"" said a gynaecologist from J J Hospital. ,A recent NACO report said India has around 40,000 pregnant women, who are HIV positive, and 12,000 HIV infected children are born each year. Transmission of the virus from the mother to the child is as high as 30 per cent,""In the chain of HIV transmission, children are at the third tier where the virus is passed on from the father to the mother and then to the child. Often, by the time the father shows symptoms of AIDS, the children are already born, mostly with the HIV infection,"" said Dr Mamta Manglani, head of the pediatrics department at Sion Hospital. ""Joint efforts from the government as well the people can help to bring down transmission to 2 per cent, which is the ideal situation."",As part of a study in Sion Hospital, a test was carried out on 1,220 children (652 males and 568 females) for a period of one year. The test results showed that mother-to-child transmission was the most common mode of infection in 63 children (95.4 per cent) who were tested positive for HIV.  ,""We perform deliveries for at least three HIV positive mothers each month, and most are under the misconception that they must not breast feed the child. Mother's milk, in fact, has antibodies and when passed on to the child will provide immunity to deal with HIV in case of an infection,"" said Dr Alka Deshpande, head of the ART department in J J Hospital. ""Children are asymptomatic below the age of 18 months. However, by that time, if the child is HIV positive, there could be possible damage done to brain development. Early detection as well as prophylactic treatment is extremely important in the case of HIV positive mothers,"" said Manglani.,Recognising the phenomenon as a grey area, MDACS is making efforts to address the problem of mother-to-child transmission. ""We have already tied up with Federation of Obstretic and Gynaecological Socities of India (FOGSI) to specifically treat HIV positive mothers,"" said Dr S S Kudalkar, project director MDACS.

A total of 3,228 new HIV infections were detected from January till October this year as against 4,440 last year, according to Pune State AIDS Control Society (PSACS).,From January till October this year, out of 83,649 samples that were tested, 3,228 new HIV cases were detected, said PSACS nodal officer Dr R R Bamble. Of these, 1,614 men, 1,420 women, 179 children and 15 eunuchs tested positive. ,`Getting to zero' is the theme for this year's World AIDS Day (December 1), ,The thrust towards detecting new cases, bringing down the mortality rate and weeding out stigma and discrimination have been the major challenges. From January till October this year, 85,278 patients were suspected with HIV from samples collected at the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs) in the city. From among 32,119 pregnant women who were tested, 170 were found HIV positive.,The Pune Municipal Corporation set up 11 ICTCs to detect new cases of HIV infection. In association with Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society, private public partnership projects are under way at six places in the city. Bamble said efforts are under way to tie up with 39 private city hospitals to introduce projects to prevent transmission of HIV from mother to child. Emphasis has been on information, education and communication activities during major festivals in the city and as part of the celebrations on December 1 this year, several competitions have been organised. A rally will be organised on December 5 from Shaniwar Wada in which college students and non-government organisations are expected to participate. ,According to the United Nations 2011 Aids Report, every day over 7,400 people are infected with HIV and 5,500 die from AIDS- related illnesses. ,The report also points out that there has been a 50 per cent decline in the number of new HIV infections in the last 10 years in India and in Pune and other cities too there was a similar trend. A pan-India survey, conducted by Metropolis Healthcare indicates that there is maximum incidence of HIV in both males and females below 30 years. ,With a total of 9,18,277 people screened, the survey spanned eight major cities namely Mumbai, Noida, Chennai, Kolkata, Pune, Ahmedabad, Surat and Kerala from January 2010 till November this year. ,Out of 435 people in Pune, 102 tested positive for the infection, says Dr Jatinder Bhatia, chief of laboratory services.

Col Rakesh Gupta, in charge of the paediatric HIV clinic at AFMC, said only 65 knew they were suffering from HIV while 14 were aware about the mode of spread and prevention.,Thirty-three children complained of frequent sicknesses, 23 harboured feeling of anger, 19 felt isolated, 15 were fearful, 12 were not confident and 14 children were unable to concentrate. The study was done over a period of two months. Nearly 47 stayed with NGOs and a total of 84 attended school.,""We found that 10 children felt discriminated by family members, classmates and community in general while there was a history of sexual exploitation for six. What was heartening was that a majority of them wanted to fight the disease bravely.,The Department conducts a dedicated HIV clinic and over 300 HIV positive children are on a regular follow up. Most of these children are taken care of by NGOs like Mamta, Suryodaya, Disha and Deep Griha Foundation. ART has helped prevent the disease and as Brigadier Mukti Sharma, Head of the Department of Paediatrics at AMFC, said of the 50 babies born at the hospital to HIV positive parents, only one baby has been detected to be HIV positive and the rate of perinatal transmission is less than 2 per cent, which is comparable to western countries.,However, she admitted that there was a significant psychological impact in the form of frequent sicknesses, anger, isolation tendencies, fearfulness, loss of confidence and suicidal tendencies. There is a need to provide appropriate counselling, education and adopt creative ways to decrease the psychological impact of HIV/AIDS with a view to improve their quality of life, she urged.,While the AFMC study shows that there is a certain level of discrimination and stigma that persists, at the function organised on Thursday to observe World AIDS Day (December 1) Tripjeet Joneja, the first lady of the AFMC, who emphasized the need to spread awareness among young population to check this disease, released a CD on the occasion. Several rallies were organised on the occasion while an Open House was kept at National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) for the public.

The Delhi government plans to grant pensions to HIV patients, registered for treatment at Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) centres.,Announcing the new policy on World AIDS Day, Delhi Health minister Dr A K Walia said children who lost their parents to HIV but are not infected by the virus themselves will also be covered under the scheme. ,Later, Walia told Newsline, ""We will process funds to grant a monthly pension of Rs 1,000 for all HIV positive patients registered in ART centres, and ,Rs 1,650 will be granted monthly to HIV positive children."" ,He said the government had traced 35 children who had been orphaned by HIV and were living with their grandparents or relatives. These children will all be granted a monthly pension of ,Rs 2,500. The Health minister added that all diagnostic facilities, including radiological examinations like M RI and X-ray, will be made available free to HIV positive patients, he added.,""We have issued notifications to all hospitals to make all facilities free for HIV patients,"" ,Dr Walia said. ,Speaking at a function to mark the day, Chief Minister Shiela Dikshit said, ""This is only the beginning, if it appears that more money needs to be dispensed to People Living with HIV, we will issue additional funds."" ,Members of Delhi Network of Positive people said it had taken two years of constant requests and consultations with government officials for these funds to be processed. ,Hari Shankar, a member of the network, said, ""We have been deliberating with the ministers for some time. Though the amount is not a lot, it is a beginning, and we are grateful to the government for whatever they have done."" ,Union Health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, who was the chief guest at the function said that withdrawal of international funds for the control of HIV, would not affect the national program. ,""We will put in all the funds required from our own budget, but there will be no dilution in our efforts to control HIV,"" Azad said. ,He added that the Health ministry would work on clearing the ART Bill, that would bring in a law against discrimination of HIV patients. Activists have been protesting in the capital in the run up to the World AIDS Day, to demand the clearance of this bill.

,

,

,
,
,

,
A study suggesting that HIV transmission can largely be prevented with antiretroviral drugs has been named the most important breakthrough of the year by one of the world's leading scientific journals.,The journal Science has announced that the results of the ""HPTN 052"" trial, which were published in May, were the most important findings of 2011.,The HPTN 052 trial was a study of 1,763 couples, where one partner was HIV-positive and the other was not. Half the infected people received antiretrovirals, and the researchers found a 96 per cent reduction in transfer of the virus.,These results were discovered as the researchers prepared for a data and safety monitoring board meeting in the midst of the study, and as a result, the trial was ended four years early and all participants were offered antiretroviral treatment.,""HIV prevention has had very few successes,"" said Jon Cohen, a correspondent for the journal who nominated the trial to the committee deciding the award.,""The biomedical success story was limited for many years to prevention of mother to child transmission,"" Cohen was quoted as saying by MyHealthNewsDaily.,While condom use, behaviour change and circumcision have been shown to prevent HIV, ""the list of failures that have happened in prevention is incredibly long,"" Cohen said.,Calling HPTN 052 the cornerstone, Cohen said, ""It's not, in and of itself, going to solve the problem, it's not going to end the epidemic."",""It's not a vaccine, Cohen said, ""but it's the next best thing, and it's available today."",Now, the question is would the drugs work for everyone?,Because the study was conducted in heterosexual couples, it's unclear whether the same benefit would extend to men who have sex with men, the researchers said.,Some ongoing studies are attempting to answer that question, and while the mechanisms behind transmission differ slightly, it seems all uninfected partners would benefit from antiretroviral drugs, they said.,In fact, it may be unethical to run a similar trial in homosexual men at this point, given the strong evidence that the drugs work, because such a trial could be seen as withholding effective treatment from the people in the control group, said Carl Dieffenbach, of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease which sponsored HPTN 052 trial.,""I certainly think it's an important study,"" said Kevin Frost, chief executive of amFAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research. ""It has begun to shape the conversation about the role of continuing to try and scale up treatment efforts worldwide, to get people onto treatment."",But, Frost said, he is skeptical about getting funding and support for such efforts.,An NIH-funded trial, called START, is under way to determine just how soon after infection antiretroviral therapy should be started.,Dieffenbach said he is concerned with getting people to start and adhere to antiretroviral therapies.,The problem, he said, is what is known as the ""treatment cascade"": For every 100 patients who are HIV-positive, 79 are aware of it, 47 of those are linked to care, and only 26 are on treatment that is suppressing the virus in their blood.,""This is the fundamental challenge that we face now. We absolutely know that treatment matters,"" he said.

Indonesia is investigating the case of an Australian who is believed to have been infected with HIV while getting a tattoo on the resort island of Bali, an official said on Monday.,""We received a report about this case from the health ministry yesterday and officials will be visiting tattoo parlours today to verify this claim,"" said Bali health department chief Nyoman Sutedja.,""At this point, we are still investigating. We can't say for sure if the patient caught the virus from getting a tattoo or sexual contact,"" he added.,There are currently 4,200 HIV/AIDS cases on Bali, Sutedja said.,Australian health authorities on Friday said a patient diagnosed with HIV probably contracted the virus while being tattooed on the island. They did not reveal any details of the individual concerned.,More than a million tourists visit Bali every year to enjoy its white, surf beaches, nightlife and Hindu culture.,Indonesian officials said last year that the number of known HIV/AIDS cases on Bali was soaring, with one in four prostitutes reported to be HIV-positive and the number of infections jumping almost 19 per cent from the year before.

Gujarat High court today directed the state government to file an FIR in a case where 23 thalassemia-affected kids from Junagadh contracted HIV virus following blood transfusion at a civic hospital.,A division bench of acting Chief Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya and Justice J B Pardiwala asked the state government to register an FIR with in a week and file a detailed affidavit with regard to the probe done by its officials in the matter.,The court was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) by advocate Girish Das seeking fixing of responsibility in the incident where 23 kids contracted HIV virus after blood transfusion, and another petition by parents of some of the victims, who had contended that the police were not filing FIR in the case.,The state government, today, filed an affidavit in the court saying that a team of high ranking officials which probed the incident felt that the children could have been infected with HIV at some place other than the Junagadh civil hospital as they had blood transfusion at other places before.,To this the court told them that they have not submitted the enquiry report with the affidavit, and asked it to file a detailed affidavit with papers of all probes done by the officers by the next hearing.,In the PIL, Das had alleged that state government was responsible for the kids getting infected with HIV, and have sought Rs 5 lakh compensation for their families.,He further alleged that Gujarat State for Blood Transfusion and National Council for Blood Transfusion have failed in their duties for protecting fundamental rights of citizens particularly children.,Das has also demanded that the state government be directed to ensure free treatment of the affected children in a hospital of their choice.

Ahead of Anna Hazare's fast, the AIDS Society of India has dubbed as ""misinformation campaign"" the threat to inject the Gandhian and his supporters with HIV-contaminated needles, saying such fears were unfounded.,""It is difficult to contract HIV, as the virus does not survive outside human body for long. Virus dies as soon as blood dries. HIV contaminated blood, supposedly used for pricks like the ones described, doesn't pose any real risk of transmission,"" Dr Ishwar S Gilada, Secretary General of the AIDS Society of India, said.,Delhi Police had recently received a letter that threatened to infect Hazare and his followers with HIV virus contaminated needles, if they remained adamant on Lokpal agitation.,The anonymous letter stated that ""a needle team, which has prepared 500 HIV positive needles, would inject the virus in at least 1,000 people at the demonstration"".,""Ironically, such stories arise from the national capital and have a potential to create major panic among the people, particularly among those associated with Hazare's campaign,"" Gilada said.,Unfounded theories of HIV spread through casual contacts, needles, eatables and water make panic-stricken people run for help and testing, he remarked.

A year and a half after its launch, the results of the nutrition project for HIV children at Sion's Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital are being closely monitored for the possibility of framing a national policy for such children. The project, initiated by the Mumbai Districts AIDS Control Society (MDACS) and undergraduate students of Brown University, was chalked out last year to address the issue of supplementary nutrition in HIV positive children.,""Nutrition is a major issue among HIV positive children. Wasting, which is discarding useful nutrients from the body instead of using them, is common and leads to severe loss of body weight. Moreover, some Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) drugs also cause wasting. HIV positive children are more susceptible to malnutrition due to recurrent opportunistic infection, bacterial infection and low appetite,"" said Dr Mamta Manglani, head of the paediatrics department at Sion Hospital. Manglani added that special attention was being given to pre-ART children in order to strengthen their immune system before putting them on the drugs.,At present, Sion Hospital has around 1,600 children registered with the ART centre. This is the second project which provides food and nutrition care for HIV patients, but the first specifically targeted at children.While those involved in the project admit that it might be premature to call the project a success, they believe it has potential to be a catalytic force in the fight against HIV. ""As far as strengthening the immune system is concerned, there has definitely been an improvement among the children,"" Manglani said.,HIV-positive children registered with the Sion Hospital have been getting a one-kg packet of a powder that is rich in proteins (containing nachni, mung dal, chanaand soyabean) along with protein biscuits.According to an official, National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) has been trying to start such nutritional programmes across the country, but has been unsuccessful due to logistical issues.

The Gujarat High Court on Thursday ordered the state government to register an FIR against authorities responsible for the incident where 23 thalassemic children  were found infected with HIV in September this year allegedly due to negligence of staff at the Junagadh Civil Hospital and the blood bank there.,A division bench comprising acting Chief Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya and Justice J B Pardiwala passed the order on a petition jointly moved by a group of 23 parents of these children.,Demanding action against those responsible in the episode, parents of the affected children had approached the HC earlier this month after their complaints to the concerned police authorities and the district superintendent of police were not registered as FIR.,In their petition, the parents stated, ""...due to gross negligence and violation of regulatory requirements, blood infected with HIV positive was infused into the children/patients by doctors and staff of the hospital and the blood bank."",The petition is being heard by the court simultaneously with a PIL in the same incident that demands free medical treatment and compensation for the affected children.,The state government opposed the petitions. An affidavit by the principal secretary (public health) P K Taneja stated that the affected children might have got HIV infection from sources other than the blood bank at the Junagadh Civil Hospital. The affidavit also detailed the steps taken by the state government following the incident.,However, the affidavit did not pass muster with the HC, which ordered the state government to file another affidavit next week with more details to substantiate its claims and first register an FIR on the complaints given by the parents of the affected children.,Advocate Girish Das, who appeared for the petitioners, said, ""The state government told the court it has carried out an inquiry into the incident. However, the court rejected the submissions while ordering it to first register FIR before carrying out any inquiry or investigation."",Further hearing on the petitions has been scheduled for December 29.

,
In 2000, this 38-year-old was diagnosed HIV positive. Three years later, he lost his eyesight to an opportunistic infection in his cornea, contracted due to his compromised immune system. Soon after, the resident of RK Puram, South Delhi, was asked to leave his job at a private courier company.,The final blow, however, came when his family showed him the door.,Since 2003, he has been shuttling between short-stay homes for HIV patients, under the Delhi government's AIDS Control Division. The short-stay homes, or community care centres (CCCs), are links between hospitals and home care, and can house patients for a maximum of five days. After 2006, when the third phase of the National AIDS Control Program was launched, long-term care centres or hospices were derecognised by the government.,The CCCs can now only treat basic opportunistic infections and provide counselling.,The homeless man, who is currently residing at the Love Faith Society in Paharganj (one of the five CCCs in Delhi), says he is tired of the nomadic life he is being made to lead. ""I get myself referred from one home to another. People know me now, so they bend the rules and try to keep me for 15 to 20 days. But, after that, I have to move to a new home,"" he said.,Registered for anti-retroviral therapy at the Lok Nayak Hospital, he says that travelling to arrange for medicines is taking a toll on him. ""Treatment is necessary, so I travel. I know I cannot avoid that. After staying at a place for a week, I start worrying about where I will go next. It is humiliating to keep asking the officials to try and accommodate me, or see which of the other homes have vacant beds,"" he said.,Arun Kumar, the coordinator at the Paharganj centre, said, ""He has been around ever since the centre came into existence two years ago. We get lots of patients like him, who need long-term care. But we can't provide them permanent residence."",The patient had asked for referral to a centre in Mumbai in June 2011, hoping to find a more permanent solution there, said Sumit Verma, coordinator at Chelsea, another CCC in Bhajanpura, Northeast Delhi. ""I have not heard of him ever since."",After staying at Deepti Foundation, a CCC under the Maharashtra AIDS Control Society, till November, he returned to Delhi. Since then, he has already moved several times between the two homes.,""I am aware of this patient, and I know he moves around Delhi CCCs. But as per our mandate, we cannot keep patients permanently. They can stay at night shelters for the night. From this year, we will give them a monthly pension of Rs 1,000,"" said Dr A K Gupta, Additional Project Director of the Delhi State AIDS Control Society.,Authorities say in the absence of international funds, care centres are suffering. In Delhi, two of the seven homes were shut last year due to insufficient funding from the government.,A senior official at a Daryaganj home said the centre did not receive funds for four months last year. ""In 2010, they cut our staff strength from four community workers, three nurses and a full-time doctor to three community workers, two nurses and a part-time doctor. How can we help people with support diminishing so drastically?"" he asked.,Father K Tomy, chairperson of NACO's technical resource group on CCC, said, ""The number of HIV-positive persons is declining and the focus of the programme is changing. Now, we have managed to reduce the stigma in the society and are trying to help reunite patients with their families, instead of simply providing care homes.""

While there is a very high prevalence of mental health disorders among HIV/AIDS patients in India and it is estimated that up to 73 per cent would develop at least one psychiatric disorder, there is complete lack of recognition of this problem and subsequently no mitigation measures, says a preliminary study by the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS). Further, owing to the mental problems, patients are less responsive to treatments.,Accordingly, TISS is in the process of conducting a detailed national study to assess the prevailing HIV/AIDS related psycho-social burden and its impact on the mental health of patients and accordingly recommend effective social and behavioural intervention strategies to the government.,""Very little is known about the mental problems and subsequent needs of people living with HIV/AIDS in countries like India, which are most affected by the epidemic. Mental health problems have an entwined association with HIV/AIDS and the most common mental disorders include depression, anxiety disorder, suicidal intent/attempts, adjustment disorder, alcohol dependence and psychotic disorders. It's estimated that 38 to 73 per cent of HIV/AIDS patients would develop no less than one psychiatric disorder in their lifetime. Hence, the need to address their mental health needs,"" said TISS professor Shankar Das, who is undertaking the government-funded study.,""It is crucial for such patients to have easy access to mental health facilities to promote their health and well-being and to prevent secondary transmission. But despite the fact that mental health disorders are directly linked with HIV/AIDS, very little attention has been paid to this association. Data in India is not sufficient to either advocate or provide the services necessary to meet the growing mental health needs of HIV/AIDS patients,"" indicated their paper published by AIDS Care (see box).,It said the majority of patients do not receive needed treatments or services and mental health providers lack sufficient expertise to diagnose and treat symptoms of mental health needs. Further, the paper indicates that untreated mental illness leads to poorer quality of life, poorer prognosis and greater stress on family and caretakers. Lack of sensitivity, inadequate counselling and psychiatric services and trained personnel are current barriers, it concluded.,""Mental health component must be incorporated within HIV/AIDS programmes in India, which could bring about a great improvement in patients' health. We plan to identify programmes and policies that address the needs of mental health of HIV/AIDS patients. It could include ways to address stigma/discrimination, psychological support to patients and their family, specific counselling and psychiatric interventions needed,"" said Das.

Our aim was to establish whether a convenient and non-invasive HIV test that uses oral fluid was accurate by comparison with the same test with blood-based specimens, Pai told The Indian Express from Canada.,The meta-analysis, which compared studies worldwide, showed that the saliva HIV test — OraQuick HIV1/2 — had the same accuracy as the blood test for high-risk populations. ""Although previous studies have shown that the oral fluid-based OraQuick HIV1/2 test has great promise, ours is the first to evaluate its potential at a global level."" Pai and her colleagues analysed and synthesised real-life field research data from five worldwide databases. Their findings showed the saliva test is 99 per cent accurate for HIV in high risk populations, and about 97 per cent in low risk populations.,OraQuick is also being considered for potential use as an over-the-counter test in the US and in several sub-Saharan countries. This move might revolutionise HIV testing by offering a proactive option to people who, because of stigma, do not wish to attend public health centres. Hopefully, offering a confidential testing option will bring an end to the stigma associated with HIV testing, says Pai.

,

,
In a pioneering research, scientists claim to have identified a protein that can knock out HIV, which causes AIDS, by starving it of raw materials it needs to reproduce.,An international team, led by the NYU Langone Medical Center, says its research has in fact revealed a mechanism by which the immune system tries to halt spread of HIV, and harnessing this mechanism may pave the way for therapeutic research aimed at slowing the virus' progression to AIDS.,""A lot of research on viruses, especially HIV, is aimed at trying to understand what the body's mechanisms of resistance are and then to understand how the virus has gotten around these mechanisms,"" said team member Nathaniel R Landau in the 'Nature Immunology' journal.,The research focused on a protein called SAMHD1. Recent studies have found that immune cells, called dendritic cells, containing the protein are resistant to infection by HIV. But it was not clear till now how it works to protect these cells.,Now, Landau and his colleagues are able to provide an answer: When a virus, like HIV, infects a cell, it hijacks the cell's molecular material to replicate. That molecular material is in the form of deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), which are the building blocks for DNA.,Once the virus replicates, the resulting DNA molecule contains all the genes of the virus and instructs the cell to make more virus.

His parents said he had been undergoing blood transfusion at the hospital ever since he was diagnosed with thalassemia in 2011. ,""So far, my son has undergone blood transfusion on 11 occasions, and all at the Junagadh Civil Hospital,"" said Baudin Vishal.,Hospital Superintendent B T Dayalu refused to comment on the matter, saying, ""I can comment on the latest case only after a detailed report comes out."",According to hospital sources, the boy was tested positive five months after his first test report was found to be negative. His mother was tested negative, they added.,Last year, 23 children registered with this government hospital were tested HIV positive. Local police are investigating the incident after the Gujarat High Court ordered a probe into the matter. ,Earlier, the state government had given a clean chit to the hospital while maintaining that the 23 children had contracted the virus prior to their admission to the Civil Hospital. ,In the latest case, the parents said the boy was tested negative in September 2011, when the matter of the 23 affected children came to light, which suggests that he contracted HIV after an investigation was ordered in the matter. ,In the last two months, two of the 23 affected children, a boy and a girl, have died. ,Following this, the HC last week ordered to provide lifelong free of cost treatment to the rest of the affected children at civil hospitals in Rajkot, Junagadh, Jamnagar and Ahmedabad.

The Bombay High Court today granted bail to a convict in the 2002 Best Bakery case of Gujarat on medical grounds.,A division bench of Justices V M Kanade and P D Kode directed the petitioner, an HIV-positive man, to submit a personal bond of Rs 5,000. He is the first person in the case to be granted bail after an appeal was filed in the High Court against the conviction.,The court today went through the medical report submitted by the civil hospital, which states that the petitioner's 'CD4 count' had gone down to 196, and HIV infection was at 'stage 2', which requires constant medical attention. ""Considering the report, it will be appropriate to release him on bail,"" the court said.,The court has directed the petitioner to provide to the police his permanent address in Vadodara where he would be staying along with his contact number. Directing that he be released forthwith, the court also said that his condition would be reported to the nearest police station by his relatives once in two weeks. ,Fourteen persons were killed inside Best Bakery in Vadodara during the post-Godhra riots in 2002.

,
Calling it ""absolutely illegal, inhuman and insensitive,"" the Delhi High Court has slammed the government-run GTB Hospital for putting up a ""Seropositive-BioHazard"" placard against the bed of a HIV positive patient during the three days she was admitted to the hospital.,This incident was first reported by Newsline last December.,After perusing a petition that annexed some pictures of a chart resembling a placard, Justice Vipin Sanghi criticised hospital authorities for meting out such treatment to an HIV positive patient.,""Prima facie, this conduct of the hospital and its medical superintendent is wholly illegal and demonstrates lack of sensitivity,"" the court said, issuing notice to them, besides seeking response from the Central government on the issue.,Admitting the petition moved through advocate Ambalika Roy, Justice Sanghi said the hospital's acts not only breached the privacy and confidentiality of the patient but also trampled her fundamental right to live with dignity. The court observed that if the petitioner's allegations were found to be right, the hospital will have to face action for committing such an ""insensitive"" act.,""It (actions of the hospital) appears to violate the fundamental right under Article 21 (Right to life and liberty) of the Constitution of India, which ensures the right to life with dignity to every citizen. It also breaches the privacy and confidentiality of the petitioner, which was required to be maintained in relation to her medical condition,"" Justice Sanghi observed.,The court has directed all parties to file counter-affidavits in the case within four weeks and explain their stand. The incident happened last year when the patient, who is registered at the hospital's antiretroviral therapy centre, reported to the emergency, complaining of back and abdominal pain. She was later admitted to the surgery ward.,According to the petition, the patient was subjected to humiliation by doctors after she disclosed her HIV status in the emergency.

Around 250 sex workers, those living with HIV and others today took out a silent rally opposing any move to ink Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the European Union vis-a-vis supply of generic life-saving drugs, saying medicine costs would skyrocket.,It was organised by ""Ashraya"", a registered community based organisation comprising sex workers and non-sex workers living with HIV, under the umbrella of parent body Ashodaya Samithi, Mysore.,The organisation said unlike a decade ago, treatment for prolonging the life span of people living with HIV is possible now through Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART). This has been made possible primarily due to availability of generic drugs that Indian pharmaceutical industry manufactures and supplies at affordable cost to over 96 countries across the globe.,""Treatment that was costing around Rs 15,000 a month has come down to Rs 2,500 a month which makes it economically viable for the Indian government to provide it free of cost to people living with HIV"", Secretary of Ashraya, Bhagyamma said.,Accepting FTA would mean thousands of people living with HIV in India cannot afford to receive these drugs any more as its cost would skyrocket, the organisation warned.,""People living with HIV have a hope with ART. Today our government is able to give it to us free because of its affordable cost. This agreement will snatch this hope away and make us destitute once again. We cannot allow this to happen"", said Pallavi T G, President of Ashraya. ,""The rally ended on the note that the protest would intensify should the government give in to the EU demands on FTA"", she said.

In a first of its kind initiative, the United Bank of India and the State Bank of India have decided to provide customised loans for HIV patients in the country. The scheme to ""support entrepreneurship"" will be launched under the aegis of the Reserve Bank of India on a pilot basis in Imphal East district. It will then be extended to the rest of Manipur and other parts of the country.,The scheme was announced at an outreach programme of the RBI in Imphal East on Saturday, attended by a high-level team from Guwahati and RBI executive director R Gandhi.,RBI deputy general manager Thotngam Jamang said the scheme had been conceptualised to help HIV-positive people gain meaningful economic activity. ""Many of them have skilled knowledge and are well versed in traditional economic activities such as crafts etc. But there are few employment opportunities. These loans will support entrepreneurship. We are also looking at facilities like health check-ups etc,"" he said.,""We have already received two applications today from HIV-patients for loans to set up embroidery and weaving enterprises. We will consider these applications, the loans may go up to at least Rs 5 lakh. We will also be looking at providing loans to family members of HIV patients to ease their financial burden,'' said UBI chief regional manager R Bhattacharjee.,Manipur has one of the highest number of HIV-positive people in the country — around 38,000 according to the 2011 figures of the Manipur State Aids Control Society. ""Out of these, at least 70 per cent have contracted the disease through injection of drugs, while the rest are sexually transmitted — it is usually the spouse of the drug user who becomes HIV-positive after marriage,"" said L Deepak Singh, president of the Manipur Network for HIV Positive Persons.,""Most of them are school dropouts. Even when they are rehabilitated and cured of their drug problems, they cannot find employment. So starting their own business is the only way out. Since most of them come from poor families, the move to provide loans is a welcome step,"" said Singh. ,,Made to work as slave, says Indian housekeeper,A senior government official in Britain kept an Indian housekeeper as a ""slave"" and fed her leftovers for four years, according to a media report here.,The counsel for 43-year-old Pratima Das, Ian Wheaton, said she was forced to work 15 hours a day while employed as a nanny and cleaner for Shibani Rahulan, 40, the principle legal officer at the Department of Health.,According to The Sun, Wheaton told the court in London that Das claimed her passport was confiscated and she was not paid.

,

,

,
,
,

,
National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) scientists will test how safe and flexible vaginal rings are among women in their new study before lacing them with microbicides to prevent HIV infection. NARI will screen 150 women before inserting the non-medicated vaginal ring to check if it can be used safely and continuously before it can be developed as a tool to protect them from HIV.,Three sites have been identified for the clinical trial planned by the Microbicide Trials Network and funded by the US-based National Institutes of Health. A total of 150 women will be enrolled at the clinical trial site at NARI in Pune and 102 at University of Alabama, and Bronx Lebanon hospital in the US, Dr R S Paranjape, director, NARI told Newsline.,This is perhaps the first such study that looks at non-medicated vaginal rings as an important tool to be eventually used for delivering microbicides. Clinical trials with topical microbicides such as vaginal gels are underway. These are applied vaginally to prevent sexually transmitted diseases. However, according to Dr A R Risbud, Scientist F at NARI, there are issues of adherence. The gels are used at the time of intercourse and there are concerns like leakage of the product or extra wetness, says Risbud.,This ring is not a contraceptive, is non-medicated and made of silicone elastomer. It will be inserted after women are screened for infections. Once HIV and Reproductive Tract Infections are ruled out, the study will commence for a period of three months to check the acceptability of the rings among women. ,According to Neelam Joglekar, social scientist with the trial, vaginal rings could give women the power to protect themselves effectively from HIV. ""Initially, we will check if they can use it during menstruation and intercourse or whether they find it uncomfortable while doing household chores that require squatting. Once they are found to be safe, they can be used as a vehicle for delivering potent anti-retroviral drugs into the vagina.,Globally, women comprise half of the 34 million people living with HIV, according to National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO).Young women are at the risk of acquiring HIV through unprotected sex with an infected partner and a ring can be developed to help them protect themselves against the infection, scientists said. While behaviour modification (abstinence and monogamous relationship) and condoms are the only preventive measures at present, there is an urgent need to develop methods that can be controlled by women for protection against HIV, Paranjape said.

A 23-year-old woman was found hanging from the ceiling fan at her residence in South Delhi's Ayanagar area around 5.30 pm on Wednesday. The woman was HIV positive and had been married for three years. According to the woman's family, she was depressed over her prolonged illness. The family also alleged that she was tortured for dowry by her in-laws, forcing her to commit suicide. ,According to police, the woman's brother-in-law had come across the body. ""I came home on Wednesday afternoon and after having lunch went to the first floor. The door to the only room on the floor was shut. I found it unusual and started banging the door. When there was no repsonse, I went to the adjacent house, climbed the wall to reach the first floor  and found her  hanging from the ceiling fan. I ran down and informed the family,"" the brother-in-law said. Soon, the police along with a local doctor, reached the spot and the woman was taken to a hospital where she was declared dead on arrival. ,He said the woman had gone to her parents' house for her sister's wedding on January 28 and had returned a week ago. Since her return, she hardly used to speak to anyone, he added. Her family members said her husband used to keep away from her after she was diagnosed as HIV positive. ,Her mother-in-law said her son had got married to the woman on February17, 2009. She often complained about stomach pain and so her husband took her to Kerala for treatment where she underwent surgery to remove kidney stones., ""We came to know about her illness when my son took her to a hospital in Mumbai for further treatment where the doctor diagnosed her HIV positive. She was undergoing treatment at the AIIMS. She lived on the first floor of the house while the rest of the family stayed on the ground floor,"" she said. ,The woman's husband had given a complaint to police on February 16 stating that his wife had threatened to kill herself and that he wanted a divorce. The husband, in his complaint, said that on several occasions, she  turned violent. ,A case has been registered and investigations are on. After a post-mortem examination, the body was handed over to the family members. ,Isha Rastogi is a student of ,EXIMS, New Delhi.

Mehar Singh is an HIV-positive patient, and is not ashamed of it.

It was only when I was almost on my death bed that my father took me to the hospital,"" he recalls. ,From then to now has been a long journey for Mehar. Being on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) for last seven years, he has regained his health and now works at a mini-factory at his home manufacturing tools. His family has now accepted him. ,Having faced the stigma and social ostracism, Mehar, has now made it his mission to make life more bearable for other HIV-positive patients. ,President of the Punjab Networking Society for HIV-positive people, Mehar has been working as an outreach worker for such patients at Civil Hospital, Jagraon, since December 2007.,""Seventeen outreach workers are functional in Ludhiana and Amritsar hospitals and we have been spreading awareness about the disease. We tell people that by sharing food with a HIV-positive patient, no infection is spread,"" Mehar says. ,""We often come to know that patients have to suffer discrimination after they are diagnosed with HIV. One patient was expelled from his job. Another one's tea stall in a village was boycotted after the sarpanch made an announcement barring people from partaking eatables at the shop. The patient died a few months later,"" he says. ,This brings up another problem for the patients that worries Mehar - the difficulty of earning a livelihood. ""Union Health Minister Gulam Nabi Azad had announced a grant of Rs 1,000 per month to every AIDS/ HIV-positive patient, Rs 1,650 per month to every positive child and Rs 2,500 to orphans. I appeal to him to start giving the grant soon, because many patients die for want of proper diet and medicines."",Mehar also helps HIV-positive pregnant woman get appropriate treatment at hospitals. He and others have also played matchmakers for HIV-positive couples. Mehar has been appealing such patients to approach him, so that he could help them find a suitable match. ,""A lot of people hide their disease, but I believe in opening up so that I can guide more people and also remove doubts if any,"" Mehar sums up.

In its guidelines for elimination of corporal punishment in schools, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) has termed  commenting on the health condition of a child's family, especially about HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, sarcasm, and discrimination as corporal punishment. ,This is apart from the common forms of physical punishment such as slapping, caning, boxing ears etc. School boards have been asked to stipulate corporal punishment-free environment as one of the conditions for granting affiliation to schools, which should have annual audits of corporal punishment and teachers should be asked to give a written undertaking that they will not resort to such action. ,The guidelines, released on Monday at a function to mark the foundation day of the NCPCR, stated that in keeping with the provisions of the RTE Act 2009, physical punishment, mental harassment and discrimination constitute corporal punishment.,Physical punishment includes hitting, kicking, scratching, pinching, pulling the hair, giving electric shock, making children assume uncomfortable positions, and forced ingestion of items like washing soap, mud and hot spices. Mental harassment constitutes ridiculing the child about his/her parents' profession, commenting about their health status, labelling the child as difficult or shaming him/her in a bid to improve performance, and belittling the child in the classroom. ,""Discrimination is understood as prejudiced views and behaviour towards any child because of his/her caste/gender, occupation or region and non-payment of fees or for being a student admitted under the 25 per cent reservation to disadvantaged groups or weaker sections of society under RTE Act,2009. It can be latent, manifest, open or subtle,"" read the guidelines. ,The guidelines say that several sections of the Indian Penal Code, including Section 305 (abetment of suicide committed by a child), Section 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) Section 354 (outraging the modesty of a woman), Section 506 (criminal intimidation) and Section 352 (assault or use of criminal force otherwise than a grave provocation), can be used to tackle offenders. It also invokes the Protection of Civil Rights Act 1955 and the Juvenile Justice (care and Protection of Children) Act 2000 to brand corporal punishment as a criminal offence.

,
Women who initially had a common sexually transmitted bacterial infection were more than twice as likely to become infected with HIV, according to a new study in Africa.,The study by researchers at RTI International found that women with the 'emerging' sexually transmitted disease Mycoplasma genitalium are more likely to acquire HIV infection.,""Further research will be required to confirm a causal relationship and to identify risk factors for M. genitalium infection in African populations,"" said Sue Napierala Mavedzenge, Ph.D., a research investigator with the Women's Global Health Imperative at RTI International and the study's lead author.,""If findings from this research are confirmed, M. genitalium screening and treatment among women at high risk for HIV-1 infection may be warranted as part of an HIV-1 prevention strategy,"" Mavedzenge noted.,First discovered in 1980, M. genitalium is a bacterial STD that causes inflammatory conditions of the genitals and reproductive tract (urethritis, cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease). The infection, which may be present for years without causing any symptoms, can be eliminated with appropriate antibiotics.,This study used data from a larger study of HIV acquisition among young women in Zimbabwe and Uganda to assess the effects of M. genitalium on HIV risk.,In the study, 190 women who became infected with HIV during follow-up were matched to women of similar age and risk who did not acquire HIV. Both groups were tested for the presence of M. genitalium, which was evaluated as a risk factor for HIV infection.,In initial samples, when all women were HIV free, infection with M. genitalium was present in about 15 per cent of women who later developed HIV versus 6.5 per cent in women who remained HIV free. Mycoplasma genitalium was more frequent than other bacterial STDs, including gonorrhea and chlamydia.,The researchers found that after adjustment for other factors, women who initially had M. genitalium were more than twice as likely to become infected with HIV. Certain other STDs were also risk factors for HIV.,The researchers estimated that about 9 per cent of all HIV infections occurring in the study were attributable to M. genitalium. However, other factors were more strongly associated with HIV risk, especially the presence of herpes simplex virus 2 (the virus that causes genital herpes) and having a partner with HIV risk factors.

Months after 24 thalassemic children were tested HIV positive after undergoing blood transfusion at the Junagadh Civil Hospital , another eight-year-old thalassemic boy, this time from Rajkot, has met with the same fate.,However, unlike the last case in which parents of the affected children claimed to have procured blood only from Junagadh Civil Hospital, the child in Rajkot was supplied blood for regular transfusion from various blood banks run by the government, Red Cross and private clinics.,Thalassemia Jagruti Manch (TJM), a voluntary group, has promised to arrange for the best possible medical treatment for this class III student, besides running a drive to conduct tests for all thalassemic patients in the district.,""Since the blood was procured from different blood banks over the years, it will be very difficult to find the exact source of infection in this case,"" said Mital Khetani of TJM. ""However, our priority is to provide the best treatment to the child who comes from a very modest background,"" he said.,The child was diagnosed with thalassemia when he was six-months-old. He lost his father three years ago.,His uncle, who runs an auto-rickshaw, was not sure whether to file a complaint against any blood bank or not. ""I have the responsibility of two families and parents on me. I do not have time and money for the legal battle,"" he said.,The man said that in the wake of the tragedy in Junagadh, a few relatives had asked him to get HIV tests done on his nephew. The first test, done three months ago, turned out to be positive. A second test for verification was conducted on February 16, which too was positive. The child's mother's tests have been negative.,Khetani said that in September last year, free HIV test camp was organised by his organisation in Rajkot, where patients from all over Saurashtra were asked to participate. ""But the turnout was very low and nobody was tested positive. We soon held a second camp,"" he said.,Of the 23 children who were tested HIV positive between January to August 2011 in Junagadh, two have died so far. Another boy was HIV tested positive last month.,While the state government had given a clean chit to the Junagadh Civil Hospital, the High Court had ordered an inquiry by the police into the matter.

The police have begun investigation against Voluntary Blood Bank after family of a thalassemic boy, who was tested HIV positive, filed an application to register an FIR against the private blood bank.,The eight-year-old boy from Rajkot recently tested HIV positive after his family got tests conducted in the wake of Junagadh Civil Hospital incident where 24 thalassemic children were tested HIV positive.,Today, the boy's family met Commissioner of Police Geetha Johri, who instructed them to go to Bhaktinagar police station, where the application against Voluntary Blood Bank in Rajkot was accepted. ""We wanted to register an FIR against the blood bank but the police have accepted an application,"" said Jatin Patel, a friend of the affected family.,The police said an FIR could be registered by night if preliminary investigation indicated any wrongdoing on the part of the blood bank.,The family said that for last two-and-a-half years, blood for transfusion was procured from Voluntary Blood Bank only. The boy, a Class III student, was diagnosed with thalassemia within six months after his birth. The boy lost his father three years ago and his mother has been tested negative for HIV.,,Meanwhile, a team of Food and Drugs department from Gandhinagar arrived in Rajkot today to probe the matter. The team visited the blood bank, local food and drug department and talked to family of the affected boy. ""The team checked records of blood bottles provided to the child,"" sources said.

Punjab has 56,928 HIV cases, and counting. The state is particularly vulnerable with regard to injecting drug users (IDUs). ,This was stated by Dr N M Sharma, Project Director of Punjab State AIDS Control Society, at the CII conference on 'HIV/AIDS Challenges and Opportunities: Partnerships in Prevention, Treatment, Care & Support' organised at Chandigarh on Friday. ,The conference was organised in association with Indian Business Trust for HIV/AIDS (IBT). ,Dr Sharma called for corporate fund support to increase the scale and range of programs.  ,CII Chandigarh Council Vice Chairman Mr Sameer Goel supported the call, saying ""business must give back to the community."" ,He said the first corporate driven Antiretroviral Treatment (ART) centre in India was an initiative of the CII-ACC Ltd. ,Speaking on the occasion, Dr Jasjit Singh Malhi, Regional Coordinator (CST) North, National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) said, ""The focus is now on convergence at the level of the government, industry, civil society and voluntary bodies to deal with the HIV-AIDS problem, and providing treatment within the general health system. ,Dr Malhi said businesses can lend support to the socio-economic needs of victims. ,They can also launch screening facilities for their workers, put in place an in-house policy of non-discrimination, establish links with care supporters, replicate ARTs in PPP model in Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh or even donate fixed assets for such centres. ,He said travel costs and loss of wages for the day were major deterrents to patients visiting ART Centres. ,""Rs 500 crore worth of drugs were wasted due to expiry, as per recent reports. Pharmaceutical companies, which have a sizeable presence in Baddi, Himachal,  can donate such volumes to those in need instead of the medicines going waste,"" he added. ,R K Mishra, Regional Director, Commonwealth Youth Program Asia suggested that the CII map corporate engagement in AIDS support across the northern region and post it on its website. ,""The list should be updated every three months and recommendations and guidance prepared for the industry units,"" he added. ,Ambuja Cement, in a partner initiative with the Commonwealth Youth Program Asia, has set up a paper recycling unit which employs Special workers, including the HIV/AIDS infected, he informed. ,The recycled paper this unit produces is in use at Panjab University and Punjab Engineering College (PEC). ,Dr Vanita Gupta, Project Director, Chandigarh State AIDS Control Society said that among people detected with HIV positive in Chandigarh, the number of those have migrated from other states like UP and Bihar is more as compared to the city residents. ,She urged that one of the ways in which the government can help HIV positive persons by giving by better access to legal aid. ,Dr Narveer Singh, Director General and Project Director, Haryana AIDS Control Society, said businesses could issue family health cards to workers and have them go through bi-annual check-ups, including for AIDS. ,He said 13 hookah bars were banned in two months in Haryana for turning into drug dens and underscored the need for parent participation in AIDS programmes. ,Man Mohan Singh, Convenor, City Development Panel, CII Chandigarh Council, Mr Ravinder Singh, Vice President, Chandigarh Network of People Living with HIV/ AIDS also spoke on the occasion.

,
Experts have said that cases of a child getting HIV infection from father — as reported recently at JJ Hospital here — are rare, though not entirely new. The AIDS Society of India says it has come across five such cases from 2001 to 2008.  ,""In such a case, the HIV becomes a sperm-bound virus. In two cases, 90 per cent of the child's DNA matched with that of the father. This confirmed that the virus was obtained from the father and not from an external medium such as blood transfusion,"" AIDS Society of India president Dr Ishwar Gilada said.,In 1990, while in University of California, biologist Dr Bhashini Rao had co-authored a paper that established the sperm-binding ability of the HIV, indicating that the virus can directly infect the foetus without infecting the mother. ,One of the patients detected by the AIDS Society is an 18-year-old girl, who along with her father has been on Anti-retroviral Therapy (ART) for the past eight years. The mother, however, remains uninfected.,""During foetal development, blood passes on from the mother to child and not the other way round. The mother, therefore, does not get infected in such cases. We have already reported two more cases after the first case was detected,"" said Dr Alka Deshpande, head of the ART department at JJ Hospital. ,The hospital plans to publish the case observations in an international journal soon.,""In all these cases, the father has been unaware of his HIV condition. This has brought up the need for pre-conception screening not only for mothers but also fathers. Such cases cannot be predicted and prevention is possible only if there is enough information about the parents' history,"" Gilada said.  ,The National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) has a programme focusing on preventing mother-to-child transmission.,""These cases have brought to fore the importance of screening of the to-be fathers, especially those who have had multiple sex partners. Though this type of transmission may be rare, preventing a few stray cases will decrease the overall HIV load in the country,""  a NACO official said.

,
Despite several awareness campaigns and programmes, the message of HIV counselling has failed to penetrate the masses, revealed a recent survey done by the Maharashtra District AIDS Control Society (MDACS). According to the results of the survey, while 82 per cent of the surveyed persons were aware of HIV testing, 75 per cent of these people were not aware of the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres ( ICTCs) in the city. The survey had a sample size of 450 individuals and was divided into four groups; general population, pregnant women, truckers and migrant workers and the high risk groups of female sex workers and men having sex with men. ,In an attempt to draw more people for HIV counselling, MDACS will now revamp the 100 odd ICTCs in the city. The centres will now be called 'Shakti HIV/AIDS Salah Kendra' and will sport an entirely new décor. ,""The survey indicated that while people were aware of HIV testing and counselling, they didn't know where they could get it done. There has also been no visual representation of the centres. We figured that the complex term of 'ICTC' needed to be changed into something simpler and more attractive,"" said Vinitha Venkat, joint director of MDACS. ,Integrated HIV counselling and testing is important in prevention and control of HIV as well as in the early diagnosis and subsequent care and support for the patient. Interestingly, the MDACS survey said that the high risk groups were the most informed with 57 per cent of them having knowledge about ICTCs as compared to the 24 per cent of the general population. Also, 93 per cent of the high risk group was found to be aware of HIV testing as compared to the 82 per cent in the general population.,""There continues to be a lot of stigma associated with HIV. With the name 'Shakti', we want to empower people by giving them right knowledge at the right time. At these centres, the job of the counsellers will be at par with that of the doctors,"" Venkat said.,Following the recent retirement of its project director, MDACS is looking at an overall makeover of its projects and plans. ,The MDACS symbol of the red ribbon has now been changed into the red ribbon which curls up into a fist, denoting 'Shakti' or power.

,

,

,
,


,
Women engaged in sex trade in most developing countries, especially in Asia, are nearly 14 times more likely to get infected by HIV compared to general women population, a new study has claimed.,The research, an analysis of over 100 studies involving nearly 100,000 female sex workers in 50 low and medium-income countries, found that overall prevalence of HIV in these women was 12 per cent.,But, they are at 14 time increased risk of being infected compared to the general women population, said the authors who detailed their findings in The Lancet.,In 26 countries deemed to have a high HIV prevalence, the researchers found that about 31 per cent of female sex workers were HIV positive and they were 12 times more likely to be infected than women from the general population.,The region where sex workers have greater risk of getting HIV infected was Asia (29-times increases risk) compared to a 12-times increased risk in Africa and Latin America, said the researchers led by Dr Stefan Baral of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.,""We identified consistent evidence of substantially higher levels of HIV among female sex workers compared with all women of reproductive age in low-income and middle-income countries in all regions with data,"" the authors said.,""Although female sex workers have long been understood to be a key affected population, the scope and breadth of their disproportionate risk for HIV infection had to date not been systematically documented,"" they said.,""These findings suggest an urgent need to scale up access to quality HIV-prevention programming and services among female sex workers because of their heightened burden of disease and likelihood of onward transmission through high numbers of sexual partners as clients,"" they concluded.,In view of the heightened HIV burden female sex workers carry in these countries, the researchers said improvement of linkages to antiretroviral treatment, retention in care and ongoing prevention for sex workers with HIV is crucial.,""Considerations of the legal and policy environments in which sex workers operate and the important role of stigma, discrimination and violence targeting sex workers globally will be required to reduce the disproportionate disease burden,among these women,"" they said.,Commenting on the findings, Dr Kate Shannon and Dr Julio Montaner of the British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS in Vancouver said: ""As the epidemic matures in many settings, with some countries already reporting over 50 per cent of sex workers living with HIV, comprehensive initiatives simultaneously targeting HIV prevention, ART access, and care are increasingly vital.,""As highlighted in a recent report by the UNAIDS advisory on sex work and HIV, removal of structural barriers (such as criminalised laws and policies, violence) remains a necessary precondition to an effective HIV response in sex work worldwide,"" they added. ,

The Centre on Tuesday told the Supreme Court that there were around 25 lakh homosexuals in the country of which 1.75 lakh  — seven per cent — were HIV-infected.,An affidavit filed in the court by Sayan Chatterjee, Secretary, Department of AIDS Control, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, says, ""The population of men who have sex with men (MSM) was estimated to be 25 lakh in India."" ,The affidavit cites the figures of the National Aids Control programme.,He said the government was working on bringing four lakh high-risk MSM under the AIDS control programme, of which two lakh are already covered. The incidence of HIV among female sex workers is 4.60-4.94 per cent and among MSM it is 6.54-7.23 per cent. In the case of drug addicts, HIV is the highest at 9.42-10.30 per cent, the affidavit, filed as per directions of the Bench at the last hearing, says.,It also says that due to the government's AIDS control programme, there has been reduction of HIV prevalence and deaths due to AIDS.,During resumed hearing on the controversial issue of decriminalising same-sex relations, the Bench headed by Justice G S Singhvi told Additional Solicitor General Mohan Jain that the earlier ""carefully-worded"" affidavit filed by the Union Home Ministry did not say if the Cabinet had accepted the Delhi High Court reading down portions of Section 377, which criminalises sexual relations between members of the same sex.,At the last hearing on February 29, the Centre, which had earlier drawn flak for shifting its stance on the issue, had filed an affidavit saying that on the advice of a GoM, the Cabinet had decided against taking any stand on the issue and had decided to await the decision of the apex court.,During Tuesday's hearing, counsel for NGO Naz Foundation, which was the petitioner in the Delhi HC, asserted that continued criminalising of gay sex prevents homosexuals from coming out in the open.,""This population is hidden in society and they are not available for getting proper healthcare facilities. There is a greater chance of the transmission of disease among them,"" advocate Anand Grover, appearing for the NGO, said. ,To this, the court asked him to place the reports and the studies done by experts to substantiate his arguments.

,
It took almost six months and a censure by the Delhi High Court for the government-run GTB Hospital to respond to a legal notice of an HIV-positive patient, who alleged that her treating doctors put up a chart ""resembling a placard"", which stated ""Seropositive-Bio-Hazard"" near her bed during the three days she was admitted at the hospital. ,The hospital, in its e-mail to the patient's lawyer Ambalika Roy, has asked for a meeting with her in order to resolve the issue. ,Roy disclosed this during a recent  court hearing. The court had earlier admitted her petition and issued notices to the government and the hospital. ,Appearing before Justice Vipin Sanghi, Roy said she had on February 24 received an e-mail from the hospital authorities, asking her and her client to have a meeting with them. ""Since the matter is sub-judice and the court had issued notices, we haven't responded to the mail,"" Roy said. ,Taking her submission on record, Justice Sanghi gave a go-ahead to Roy and made it clear that any meeting with the hospital will have no prejudice to the petitioner's rights and contentions before the court wherein she had demanded action against the erring doctors, besides a compensation of Rs 10 lakh on account of agony and harassment. ,""You can meet them and see what they want to discuss. This will have no impact on your contentions before the court and you can inform the court about the meeting's outcome, if any, on the next date of hearing,"" the judge said. ,Meanwhile, counsel appearing for the hospital said that although they were yet to ascertain if any placard was put up or not, sensitisation of the staff was already underway, especially that of the nursing staff. ,""An inquiry has already been ordered to ascertain the veracity of the allegations. Preliminary findings suggest that a notice, and not a placard, was put up to ensure that treating doctors and nursing staff were cautious of infection. Moreover, a technical term — Seropositive — was used and it was not too offensive,"" said the counsel. ,This argument, however, failed to impress Justice Sanghi, who forwarded to the hospital's counsel a relevant photograph of a chart resembling a placard and asked how they could justify describing her a ""Bio-Hazard"". ,Earlier, calling it ""absolutely illegal, inhuman and insensitive"", Justice Sanghi had slammed the GTB Hospital for putting up the impugned placard. ,The incident happened last year when the patient, who is registered at the hospital's anti-retroviral therapy centre, reported to the emergency, complaining of back and abdominal pain. She was later admitted to the surgery ward. According to the petition, the patient was subjected to humiliation by doctors after she disclosed her HIV status in the emergency.

And all these years he has been undergoing treatment only at the Junagadh Civil Hospital,"" said the boy's father. ""To go far or to any private hospital is not an affordable option for us.

,


,
In a major breakthrough in the fight against AIDS, scientists claim to have for the first time shown that human stem cells can be genetically engineered to seek out and kill HIV-infected cells in a living organism.,The study demonstrates for the first time that engineering stem cells to form immune cells that target HIV is effective in suppressing the virus in living tissues in an animal model, said lead scientist Scott G Kitchen.,He added: ""We believe that this study lays the groundwork for the potential use of this type of an approach in combating HIV infection in infected individuals, in hopes of eradicating the virus from the body."",In their previous research, the scientists took CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes -- the ""killer"" T cells that help fight infection -- from an HIV-infected individual and identified the molecule known as the T cell receptor, which guides T cell in recognising and killing HIV-infected cells.,In their latest research, the scientists at California University similarly engineered human blood stem cells and found that they can form mature T cells that can attack HIV in tissues where the virus resides and replicates.,They did so by using a surrogate model, the humanised mouse, in which HIV infection closely resembles the disease and its progression in humans.,In a series of tests on the mice's peripheral blood, plasma and organs conducted two weeks and six weeks after introducing the engineered cells, the scientists found that the number of CD4 ""helper"" T cells -- which become depleted as a result of HIV infection -- increased, while levels of HIV in the blood decreased.,CD4 cells are white blood cells that are an important component of immune system, helping to fight off infections. These results indicated that the engineered cells were capable of developing and migrating to the organs to fight infection there, the 'PLoS Pathogens' journal reported.,""We believe that this is the first step in developing a more aggressive approach in correcting the defects in the human T cell responses that allow HIV to persist in infected people,"" Kitchen said.

The first drug shown to prevent HIV infection won the endorsement of a panel of US federal advisers, clearing the way for a landmark approval in the 30-year fight against the virus that causes AIDS.,In a series of votes on Thursday, a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel recommended approval of the daily pill Truvada for healthy people who are at high risk of contracting HIV, including gay and bisexual men and heterosexual couples with one HIV-positive partner.,The FDA is not required to follow the panel's advice, though it usually does. A final decision is expected by June 15.,An estimated 1.2 million Americans have HIV, which develops into AIDS unless treated with antiviral drugs. ,Gilead Sciences Inc., based in California, has marketed Truvada since 2004 as a treatment for people who are infected with the virus. The medication is a combination of two older HIV drugs, Emtriva and Viread. ,While panelists ultimately backed Truvada for prevention, Thursday's 12-hour meeting highlighted a number of concerns created by the first drug to prevent HIV. In particular, the panel debated whether Truvada might lead to reduced use of condoms, the most reliable defence against HIV.

Acting on a plea against the recent transfer of the police officer who was probing the case in which around 25 thalassemic children from Junagadh had tested HIV+ after undergoing blood transfusion at a blood bank at the Junagadh Civil Hospital last year, the High Court on Tuesday ordered the investigating officer to remain present before the court on April 26.,The petitioner, Girish Das, had alleged that the investigating officer in the case was transferred at a time when the probe was in a ""crucial"" stage.,Das had earlier moved a public interest litigation on the matter.,According to Das, Assistant SP Shobha Bhutada, who was investigating the case, was recently promoted and transferred to Amreli district as SP with malafide intention to so that the investigation could be remote-controlled. He has demanded a direction to the state government to make sure that Bhutada completes the investigation in the case despite her transfer.,In February this year, the HC had ordered the state government to register an FIR in the case against those responsible on the basis of a complaint lodged by the parents of the victim children. The court had also ordered to get the investigation supervised by a senior police officer of DIG rank.,The entire episode of the thalassemic children getting HIV infection allegedly during blood transfusion at government hospital due to negligence of authorities had surfaced in September last year.

,

,

,
,


,
A clause in the HIV and AIDS (Prevention and Control) Bill 2012 that HIV testing cannot be a precondition for employment has raised some practical roadblocks in the recruitment process of the paramilitary forces and police, and become a bone of contention between the Ministry of Home Affairs and the department of AIDS control.,The MHA holds that it is not possible to recruit HIV-positive people in the paramilitary forces because of the high physical requirement standards and also because community living in such forces could spread the infection through ""cuts and bruises"" — ironically, a notion the government's own AIDS awareness programmes try hard to dispel. ,The long-pending Bill, which seeks to stop discrimination against people suffering from HIV/AIDS by making it a penal offence, is going to be taken up by the Cabinet soon. It provides for imprisonment of three months to two years and a fine of up to Rs 1 lakh or both for HIV-related discriminatory propaganda. ,There are two major points of disagreement between MHA and the AIDS control department. ,MHA has said that the confidentiality clause on HIV status cannot be honoured for men in the forces or personnel living a community life often in enclosed quarters with common barbers and paramedics because not making HIV status of a person known would make others sharing the place with him/her susceptible. They have also demanded that the clause banning mandatory testing for employment should not apply to the forces and police. ,It has also raised concerns about the risk of infection to all those around an HIV-positive person and in case of injuries which are a common occurrence because of the nature of the job. It also raised concerns on paramedical and medical staff tending to the person, particularly in a remote area where it is not possible to undertake HIV testing. ,The AIDS control department has tried to dispel MHA doubts with laborious explanations about how the spread of the disease through common cuts and bruises is ""minimal"" and countries like Canada, Belgium and Ukraine — and also the United Nations — have rejected discriminatory practices in their armed forces and instead focussed on HIV prevention information among the forces. ,MHA also holds that the clause that no person can be denied job on the basis of their HIV status is not acceptable because in the paramilitary forces and police, there is a very high physical standard set and even a squint or a flat foot could render a person ineligible. How would a person suffering from HIV/AIDS, who is already immuno deficient, then undergo such rigorous training and duties in difficult positions. ,The department of AIDS control counters this, saying medical evidence shows persons living with HIV can remain physically fit for up to 15-20 years while on anti- retroviral therapy during which they are good enough for any work. ,The final call on the debate will have to be taken by the Cabinet when it takes the Bill up for consideration.

There has been an acute shortage of HIV detection kits across 42 Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs) in Pune district. Every month, around 15,000 persons get themselves voluntarily tested for HIV at the centres in the district of which less than 3 per cent are detected with HIV. However services have been hampered for nearly two months now. ,The inadequate supply of detection kits from National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) has also hampered HIV testing services across 578 ICTCs across the state. Admits Dr Ramesh Deokar, project director Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS), ""There is a monthly requirement of 2.8 lakh test kits across 578 ICTCs in the state. Each month, a report is sent to NACO regarding the state's requirement and consumption. We have been waiting for the supply for nearly two months."" ,Sandeep Dhawle, programme  officer, District AIDS Prevention Control Unit, said that most people reporting for voluntary HIV testing have been instructed to come in May. Barring high-risk patients like those suffering from tuberculosis or pregnant women, the general population reporting to ICTCs for HIV testing have not been receiving the services since March. ,Officials of the Anti Retroviral Treatment (ART) Centre at Sassoon General Hospital that caters to more than 6,000 patients pointed out that there has been a shortage of HIV detection kits. There are three tests that need to be performed on blood samples to check for antibodies against the HIV antigen. The first test is most important as it picks up positivity of the virus and is extremely sensitive. Kits for mainly this test are in short supply while those fo the second and third tests are available. ,When contacted, Dr R R Rao, project officer, ICTC, NACO, told Newsline that there was a shortfall as consumption in the last few months was higher than expected. ""We have started relocating supplies and the test kits will be available by first week of May."",,Additional Anti Retroviral Treatment (ART) centres have been proposed in the city with NACO officials visiting Pune to check the proposed sites. Each centre is required to have a minimum of 2,500 HIV patients taking ART. However at Sassoon more than 6,000 are on ART. The remaining three centres in the city at YCM hospital, Pimpri, National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) at Gokhale Nagar and the Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC) have a sizeable intake of HIV patients. To decongest the government hospital, NACO has proposed more centres in the city. Three sites were surveyed and meetings with PMC and PCMC officials held recently, said Dr Anwar Parvez, Regional Coordinator, (HIV Care , Support and Treatment) Maharashtra and Goa. The sites include PMC's Rajiv Gandhi Hospital at Yerawada, Navle hospital and Bharati hospital. These sites have not ben finalised, he added.

Incidence of violence of all forms is significantly higher among HIV-positive women than among HIV-negative women, a study conducted by doctors at the Armed Forces Medical College here revealed.,Conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Pune on a randomly selected 150 married women (75 HIV-positive and 75 HIV-negative) seeking treatment there, the study revealed that 56 per cent of HIV-positive women reported of domestic violence.,Violence and the fear of violence are emerging as important risk factors contributing to the vulnerability to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among women, the study said.,The finding highlighted in this study is the strong association between violence and women's HIV status. A study on National Family Health Survey-3 data of India had found that married Indian women experiencing both physical and sexual violence from husbands demonstrated elevated HIV infection prevalence in comparison to those not experiencing intimate partner violence.,Informed consent was obtained from all the women and also a trained counsellor was present during the process of data collection.,The data was collected by conducting interviews, taking precautions as laid down in the World Health Organization's ethical and safety recommendations for research on domestic violence and using modified conflict tactics scale (CTS).,The definition of violence followed is as per the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1993.,HIV-positive status, rural residence, number of children, and alcohol consumption by husband were significant factors putting the women at higher risk of domestic violence, the study showed.

American consumers may soon be able to test themselves for the virus that causes AIDS in the privacy of their own homes, after a panel of experts on Tuesday recommended approval of the first rapid, over-the-counter HIV test.,The 17 members of the federal Food and Drug Administration advisory panel voted that benefits of the OraQuick HIV test outweigh potential risks. The test uses a mouth swab to return a result in 20 minutes.,The FDA will make its final decision on whether to approve the product later this year. Based in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, Orasure has marketed a version of OraQuick to health care practitioners since 2004. When used by professionals, the test accurately identifies carriers and non-carriers 99 per cent of the time. But a trial conducted by the firm showed the home test correctly detected HIV in those carrying the virus 93 per cent of the time.

With increasing access to Antiretroviral Treatment (ART), people living with HIV (PLHIV) have the chance to live longer, fulfilling lives and to plan for the future. This was the underlying premise for a workshop held in the city on Monday.,Members from 20 NGOs gathered at Hotel Kapila to participate in in 'Koshish', a project backed by the European Union, to strengthen civil society organisations and networks, specifically those representing and working with PLHIV and other key populations — men who have sex with men (MSM), sex workers (SW), transgender (TG) and people who use drugs — to advocate for the development and implementation of programmes for PLHIV in India.,Manoj Pardeshi, secretary of Network of People Living with HIV in Maharashtra said there is evidence that suggests a comprehensive approach to sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) has been lacking and current responses are not sufficiently decreasing vulnerability and ill-health. ,Studies among PLHIV show high rates of unmet contraceptive need, untreated STIs, and lack of knowledge and skills on safer sex and broader positive prevention, he said. Among PLHIV from marginalised groups, these health indicators show even higher rates of unmet sexual and reproductive health needs and violations of related human rights.,'Koshish' will enable community-based organisations to engage with key decision makers, such as government institutions and state and national level authorities to ensure that the rights of PLHIV are supported.,Apart from Maharashtra, the project is being implemented in Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. In each state, five districts have been selected for project implementation.

The Medical Council of India (MCI) has issued guidelines for all private medical practitioners across the country to keep records of HIV patients visiting them for treatment.,The guideline comes after a sgnificant rise in complaints related to negligence in treatment of HIV-positive patients in private establishments. The order (MCI-211(2) 2010/ethics /Gen 33690) states that if a request is made by relatives of an HIV-positive patient for medical records, the private practitioner is bound to provide them details within 72 hours. If he fails to do so, his registration will be cancelled under the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations 2002.,According to the circular, the private practitioner has to keep the medical records of an HIV-positive patient under his supervision for at least three years.,A majority of city-based private doctors, however, said they were not aware of such a circular. Dr S N Banerjee, director of medical education, said an awareness campaign for doctors will be conducted in the state.,The state health department is responsible for generating awareness about such circulars being by the MCI.

,

,

,
,
,

,
Breast milk has a strong virus killing effect and can protect against oral transmission of HIV, a new study has found.,More than 15 percent of new HIV infections occur in children. Without treatment, only 65 percent of HIV-infected children will live until their first birthday, and fewer than half will make it to the age of two. ,Although breastfeeding is attributed to a significant number of these infections, most breastfed infants are not infected with HIV, despite prolonged and repeated exposure.,The question of whether breast milk transmits the virus or protect against it has been a mystery for HIV researchers.,Now new research from the University of North Carolina School of Medicine explores this paradox in a humanized mouse model, demonstrating that breast milk has a strong virus killing effect and protects against oral transmission of HIV.,""This study provides significant insight into the amazing ability of breast milk to destroy HIV and prevent its transmission,"" said J. Victor Garcia, PhD, senior author on the study and professor of medicine in the UNC Center for Infectious Diseases and the UNC Center for AIDS Research. ,""It also provides new leads for the isolation of natural products that could be used to combat the virus,"" Garcia stated.,Garcia and colleagues pioneered the humanized ""BLT"" mouse model, which is created by introducing human bone marrow, liver and thymus tissues into animals without an immune system of their own. Humanized BLT mice have a fully functioning human immune system and can be infected with HIV in the same manner as humans.,In the study, the researchers first determined that the oral cavity and upper digestive tract of BLT mice have the same cells that affect oral transmission of HIV in humans and then successfully transmitted the virus to the mice through these pathways. When the mice were given virus in whole breast milk from HIV-negative women, however, the virus could not be transmitted.,""These results are highly significant because they show that breast milk can completely block oral transmission of both forms of HIV that are found in the breast milk of HIV-infected mothers: virus particles and virus-infected cells,"" said Angela Wahl, PhD, a post-doctoral researcher in Garcia's lab and lead author on the paper. ,""This refutes the 'Trojan horse' hypothesis which says that HIV in cells is more stubborn against the body's own innate defenses than HIV in virus particles,"" she stated.,Finally, the researchers studied the effectiveness of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with antiretroviral medication for oral transmission of HIV. ,Garcia and his team have previously shown that PrEP is effective against intravenous, vaginal and rectal transmission of HIV in humanized BLT mice. In this study, they gave the mice antiretroviral drugs for seven days (3 days before and 4 days after exposing them to the virus) and found 100 percent protection against virus transmission.,These latest findings provide important leads to alternative treatments that could be used to prevent transmission.,""No child should ever be infected with HIV because it is breastfed. Breastfeeding provides critical nutrition and protection from other infections, especially where clean water for infant formula is scarce,"" Garcia said. ,""Understanding how HIV is transmitted to infants and children despite the protective effects of milk will help us close this important door to the spread of AIDS,"" she noted.,The study appears in the June 14, 2012 issue of the online journal PLoS Pathogens.

,,The hunt for an HIV vaccine continues to be elusive with clinical trials unlikely to move to Phase II at the premier National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) in Pune and the Tuberculosis Research Centre (TRC) at Chennai, but scientists do not perceive it as a setback.,They say conducting such highly sophisticated prime-boost clinical trials using complex vectors - DNA-based vaccine ADVAX was used as prime and Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) as boost in Phase 1- has in fact opened up a platform for trials for other vaccines.,When contacted, Dr V M Katoch, Director General, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said an HIV vaccine committee is reviewing the process. ""Our advances in research have in fact helped us to now to take on trials for developing other vaccines,"" Katoch told The Indian Express.,Phase I trials are meant for studying safety of the vaccine in humans and its ability to stimulate immune responses. ADVAX was earlier tested in the US and found safe. MVA vector, tested at TRC in 2008, also showed it was safe. ,The recent HIV vaccine trial tested both DNA/MVA or MVA/MVA prime-boost strategies, says Dr R S Paranjape, Director, NARI. Both these regimens were found safe and evoked a modest immune response in majority of the volunteers in Phase 1. ,""However, when genetic stability assessment studies were undertaken to determine stability of the encoded genes, we found that the vector was identified as genetically unstable. This was despite several strategies  assessed in parallel to stabilize the vector,"" says Paranjape.,Observations like those seen with this candidate are normal in course of vaccine development, said Dr V D Ramanathan, Director Grade Scientist at TRC, Chennai and one of the principal investigators of the trial.,India started it search for an AIDS vaccine in 2005 and the Adeno associated vector study was the first vaccine trial taken up. The trials were completed in December 2006. The vaccine met safety criteria, but did not induce immune responses in sufficient number of volunteers to meet the criteria for further trials.  ,The International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) has been partnering with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in India through the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) since 2002 to implement AIDS vaccine research and development programme.,Dr Rajat Goyal, Director of International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, India operations, said the road to vaccine development has been traditionally very difficult, but due to the clinical trials, the infrastructure and human resource capacity developed in various ICMR institutes that participated in HIV vaccine trials will be able to contribute to evaluation of other potential vaccines as well.

It was Gaviria who led Colombia when police gunned down the notorious drug-runner Pablo Escobar in 1993.,Other supporters include the European Union's former foreign policy chief Javier Solana and George Shultz, the who served as US secretary of state during Ronald Reagan's presidency.,The report accused the US, Russia and Thailand of ignoring scientific evidence about the relationship between law enforcement policies and HIV rates ""with devastating consequences."",The increased availability of drugs worldwide proved that the strategy was failing, it added.,""The war on drugs has failed, and millions of new HIV infections and AIDS deaths can be averted if action is taken now,"" it concluded.

""The response has been very overwhelming as the MPs came out in large numbers,"" said Dube. More lawmakers were expected to undergo tests on Friday when they take the campaign to a public square in the capital. According to the United Nations, Zimbabwe has made drastic achievements in fighting HIV, with 14 percent of the population with Aids in 2009, down from 23 percent in 2003. Blessing Chebundo, a lawmaker from Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai's party, said taking part in the campaign was his way of leading from the front. ""By knowing my status, I am trying to fight discrimination. What we are doing here is unique,"" said Chebundo. In March, Mugabe told parliament that some of his political allies had died of Aids.

,
,,There were six HIV-positive girls (between 5 to 17 years of age) found in the Apna Ghar, the controversial shelter home in Rohtak district now sealed by the Haryana police, who were also allegedly subjected to sexual abuse at the behest of the in-charge and prime accused Jaswanti Devi and her son-in-law Jai Bhagwan. ,The fact came to fore when a team of National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) raided the shelter home on May 9. However, despite NCPCR urging it not to do so, the Haryana government moved all the inmates of Apna Ghar to various other shelter homes in the state. ,""Despite our strict instructions, the Haryana government transferred the inmates, including children, without getting their proper medical examination conducted. The top brass of Haryana government, including the concerned departments' principal secretaries, the Director General of Police, who appeared before us last month were instructed to get a complete medical check-up done of all the inmates and not to transfer any of them. The officers had assured us to comply by the instructions, but failed to do so,"" Vinod Tikoo, who led the NCPCR team that raided Apna Ghar, told The Indian Express. ,Now, this has created a scare more inmates could be detected HIV positive. Till all the inmates are medically examined, the exact number could not be ascertained. ,""The possibility of more inmates, including children, being HIV positive, can not be ruled out. Despite our recommendations, the state government took only eight girls for medical examination to PGIMER, Chandigarh. What about the rest over 100 inmates? Why were not they medically examined,"" Tikoo asked.,Earlier, in January, the NCPCR team had raided another shelter home in Gurgaon, run by Drone foundation and found that the inmates were sexually abused by the caretakers and operators of the home. Thirteen children were transferred out of Drone foundation shelter home to another shelter home in Delhi. From Delhi, out of the 13 children, six girls were transferred to Apna Ghar in Rohtak, while the remaining seven, all boys, were transferred to another shelter home in Karnal. The seven boys are also found HIV-positive. ,""Haryana government can not escape the liability,"" Tikoo said.,,Medical check-up of all inmates by deputing a medical team from district hospital/ medical college of Rohtak. Compliance report in 10 days ,Additional Deputy Commissioner, Rohtak, to conduct inquiry and submit a report on Apna Ghar, within 30 days ,There were 65 inmates of less than 18 years, found in Apna Ghar, against 56 mentioned in attendance register. It shall not be appropriate to shift them to other shelter homes. ,Provide Security to the Home and children with a PCR Van stationed outside the premises and deploy policemen in plainclothes, to escort children to schools ,Enroll all children of the Home into age-appropriate classes in a neighbourhood school within a week's time.

,

,

,
,
,

,
The US Food and Drug Administration on Monday approved the first drug shown to reduce the risk of HIV infection, a milestone in the 30-year battle against the virus that causes AIDS.,The agency approved Gilead Sciences' pill Truvada as a preventive measure for people who are at high risk of acquiring HIV through sexual activity, such as those who have HIV-infected partners. The approval marks the first time an HIV drug has been prescribed for people who have not yet been infected. ,Public health advocates say the approval could help slow the spread of HIV, which has held steady at about 50,000 new infections per year for the last 15 years. ,An estimated 1.2 million Americans have HIV, which develops into AIDS unless treated with antiviral drugs. With an estimated 2,40,000 HIV carriers unaware of their status, doctors and patients say new methods are needed to fight the spread of the virus worldwide.,""Today's approval marks an important milestone in our fight against HIV,"" said Margaret Hamburg, Commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, in a statement.,Gilead Sciences Inc. has marketed Truvada since 2004 as a treatment for people who are already infected with the virus.,But starting in 2010, studies showed that the drug could actually prevent people from contracting HIV when used as a precautionary measure. ,A three-year study found that daily doses cut the risk of infection in healthy gay and bisexual men by 42 per cent, when accompanied by condoms and counseling. Last year another study found that Truvada reduced infection by 75 per cent in heterosexual couples in which one partner was infected with HIV and the other was not.,Because Truvada is on the market to manage HIV, some doctors already prescribe it as a preventive measure. ,FDA approval will allow Gilead Sciences to formally market the drug for that use, which could dramatically increase prescribing.,Truvada's groundbreaking preventive ability has exposed disagreements about managing the disease among those in the HIV community. ,Groups including the AIDS Healthcare Foundation asked the FDA to reject the new indication, saying it could give patients a false sense of security and reduce the use of condoms, the most reliable preventive measure against HIV.,But FDA scientists said Monday said there was no indication from clinical trials that Truvada users were more likely to engage in any kind of risky sexual behaviour. ""What we found was that condom use increased over time and sexually transmitted infections either remained at baseline levels or decreased,"" said Dr. Debra Birnkrant, FDA's director of antiviral products.

The US's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has for the first time approved a drug to prevent HIV infection through sexual activities. The drug, Truvada, is in use since 2004 as a part of retroviral therapy for HIV-I but the FDA green signal on Monday makes it the first approved drug for prevention of the dreaded virus.,Though medically it is a significant step in control of HIV-AIDS, doctors in India say the prohibitive cost of the drug — $14,000 annually — is unlikely to make it a potent weapon from the public health perspective in this country. ,The pill has to be taken once daily for prevention of infection but the FDA statement says that it should ideally be used in combination with safe sex practices. ,The results of clinical trials for efficacy of the drug were found promising. The risk of infection was reduced by 42 per cent in a study sponsored by the National Institutes of Health of about 2,500 HIV-negative gay and bisexual men and transgender women, and by 75 per cent in a study sponsored by the University of Washington of about 4,800 heterosexual couples in which one partner was HIV-positive and the other was not. ,The drug is a combination of two anti-retroviral medications used to treat HIV-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine. ,Debra Birnkrant, director of the Division of Antiviral Products at FDA, says Truvada works to prevent HIV from establishing itself and multiplying in the body. ""In the 80s and early 90s, HIV was viewed as a life-threatening disease; in some parts of the world it still is. Medical advances, along with the availability of close to 30 approved individual HIV drugs, have enabled us to treat it as a chronic disease most of the time. But it is still better to prevent HIV than to treat a life-long infection of HIV,"" she says.,FDA has also laid down a number of conditions for prescription of the drug, all geared towards ensuring that there isn't already an infection. Hence flu-like symptoms are a red flag. The drug also cannot be used if there is a hepatitis B infection as the disease often tends to get worse when Truvada use is stopped. ,India has a substantial load of new infections though the absolute numbers have gone down in the past 10 years. In 2007, there were an estimated 2.5 million new cases. ,However, Truvada, principally because of its cost, is unlikely to emerge as a public health option in fighting HIV-AIDS in India, says Dr C S Pandav, professor and head of the centre of community medicine at AIIMS and president of the Indian Public Health Association. ,""The cornerstones of HIV-AIDS programme in India would have to remain A (for abstinence), B (for be faithful) and C (for condoms). The average per capita income in India is about $1,000, how can we even think of adopting a drug that costs $14,000 annually,"" Dr Pandav says.

For the first time, a once-a-day pill which reduces the chance of contracting HIV among high risk groups ""significantly"" has got green signal in the US, where 1.2 million people are infected by the deadly disease.,The drug,'Truvada' can now be used by those at high risk of the infection and anyone who may engage in sexual activity with HIV-infected partners, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced.,In two large clinical trials, daily use of the drug was shown to significantly reduce the of HIV infection,"" it said yesterday.,However, some health workers and groups active in the HIV community opposed the approval for the once-a-day pill.,There are concerns that circulation of such a drug could engender a false sense of security and mean people will take more risks. There have also been fears that a drug-resistant strain of HIV could develop.,People diagnosed with HIV that without treatment develops into AIDS take antiviral medications to control the infection that attacks their immune system.,In a statement, the FDA stressed that the drug should be used as part of a ""comprehensive HIV prevention plan"", including condom use and regular HIV testing.,An advisory group of health experts recommended approval for the pill in May this year.,Truvada, is already backed by the FDA to be taken with existing antiretroviral drugs for people who have HIV.,Studies have shown that Truvada reduced the risk of HIV in healthy gay men - and among HIV-negative heterosexual partners of HIV-positive people - by between 44 per cent and 73 per cent.,""In the 80s and early 90s, HIV was viewed as a life-threatening disease; in some parts of the world it still is.

The body's immune system is devastated by AIDS, leaving those who have it vulnerable to deadly infections. Each year, about 50,000 adults and adolescents in the US are newly diagnosed with HIV.

Daunted by the fear of giving birth to infected children, HIV positive women in Odisha's Kendrapara district are mostly opting to medically terminate their pregnancies.,In the recent past, at least a dozen such instances have taken place. In earlier cases also, majority of expectant mothers who contracted HIV had abortions, according to health officials of government-run hospitals in the region.,""We have asked the state AIDS control society-run integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTC) to provide counselling for HIV-infected pregnant women and to instill in them confidence,"" said additional district medical officer Manoj Behera.,In the past 12 months, two dozen such abortions were  eported. Ironically, the majority of them were carried out in private clinics, in violation of provisions of the Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act and the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, sources said.,Of the 561 infected persons, there are about 72 couples who have tested HIV positive. Many are scared of getting branded as AIDS patients as there are instances of victims here being ostracised.,There is a regular exodus of skilled labour from these parts of the state to the country's urban and industrial centers triggered by poverty and a lack of employment opportunities.,Migrant labours contract the virus and bring it home to their family members. Over 90 per cent of the 561 HIV carriers were migrant workers, according to officials.,

A suicide note has been found which said the victim was suffering from AIDS and undergoing treatment at a hospital in Mumbai where he worked as a taxi driver. He had returned from Mumbai around 15 days ago.,""The victim also stated in the suicide note that his wife is also suffering from the same disease and he was taking the extreme step because treatment of the disease is costly and he could not afford it,"" said sub-inspector Kailash Khushwaha.

The state government on Tuesday withdrew its petition in the Supreme Court whereby it had challenged the Gujarat High Court order to transfer the investigation in the case of 25 thalassemic children testing HIV+  after undergoing blood transfusion at a private blood bank at the Junagadh Civil Hospital to CBI.,Unhappy with the investigation done by the Gujarat Police in the case, the HC had handed over the probe to CBI last month. ,The state government's petition came up for hearing in the SC before a bench of Justices H L Dattu and Chandramauli Kumar Prasad on Tuesday. However, when the court did not seem keen on allowing the petition, the state government withdrew the same.,Meanwhile, the investigation papers of the case were handed over to CBI, which has already started its probe.,In February this year, HC had ordered the state government to register an FIR in the case against those responsible on the basis of complaint lodged by the parents of the victim children. The court had also ordered to get the investigation supervised by a senior police officer of Deputy Inspector General of Police rank. However, it was not impressed by the investigation in spite of giving several chances to the state police to find out certain evidence in the case.,Eventually, on June 27, HC transferred probe to CBI while passing strictures against the state government's handling of the case.,The entire episode of the thalassemic children getting HIV infection allegedly during blood transfusion at Jamnagar Civil Hospital due to negligence of authorities had surfaced in September last year.

,
,
,

,
The US drug control authority on  Wednesday approved the first over-the-counter, self-administered HIV test kit that will enable Americans to detect on their own and in the privacy of their homes whether they are infected with the virus that causes AIDS.,The 'OraQuick In-Home HIV Test' is designed to allow individuals to collect an oral fluid sample by swabbing the upper and lower gums inside of their mouths.,The sample is then placed into a developer vial and test results are obtained within 20 to 40 minutes.,The test has the potential to identify large numbers of previously undiagnosed HIV infections, especially if used by those unlikely to use standard screening methods.,The FDA has been considering the simple mouth-swab test since 2005.,The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 1.2 million people in the United States are living with HIV infection and about one in five are not aware they are infected.,There are about 50,000 new HIV infections every year.,Many of these new infections are transmitted from people who are unaware of their HIV status.,""Knowing your status is an important factor in the effort to prevent the spread of HIV,"" director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research Karen Midthun said.,""The availability of a home-use HIV test kit provides another option for individuals to get tested so that they can seek medical care, if appropriate,"" Midthun said.,The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said a positive,result with this test does not mean that an individual is definitely infected with HIV, but rather that additional testing should be done in a medical setting to confirm the test result.,Similarly, a negative test result does not necessarily mean that an individual is not infected with HIV, particularly when exposure may have been within the previous three months.,OraSure Technologies, the manufacturer of the OraQuick In-Home HIV Test will have a consumer support centre that is available through phone and will be open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.,The centre will be operational and available to educate users with information about HIV/AIDS, the proper method for administering the test and guidance on what to do once results,have been obtained once the manufacturer makes the product available for sale to the public.,The home test is expected to be available in about 30,000 pharmacies, grocery stores and online retailers by October, OraSure's chief executive Douglas Michels said.,While the price of the kit has not yet been fixed, Michels said it would be higher than the current USD 17.50 that is charged to medical professionals because the company will do more complicated packaging for the home kit, open a 24-hour question line, and advertise to high-risk groups, including gay men, blacks and Hispanics, and sexually active adults.,The kit will be sold at an affordable rate so that it is accessible for people who might want to buy several a year, Michels added.,The test will however not be 100 per cent accurate.,Clinical studies for self-testing have shown that the OraQuick In-Home HIV Test has an expected performance of 92 per cent for test sensitivity, the percentage of results that will be positive when HIV is present.,In other words, one false negative result would be expected out of every 12 test results in HIV-infected individuals.,Clinical studies also have shown that the OraQuick In-Home HIV Test has an expected performance of 99.98 per cent for test specificity, the percentage of results that will be negative when HIV is not present.,This means that one false positive would be expected out of every 5,000 test results in uninfected individuals.,

The Gujarat High Court on Thursday sought replies from the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) and the state government on a public interest litigation which seeks a change in the standard testing method for detection of HIV virus prior to blood transfusion.,A division bench of acting Chief Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya and Justice J B Pardiwala issued the notices on the PIL filed by Babulal Thakkar, seeking replies by August 9, the next date of hearing.,At present, the standard method for detecting HIV in India is 'Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)' test or the antibody test, says the PIL, adding this test has a window period of three months — an infection acquired in the previous three months cannot be detected.,ELISA can be replaced by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test where there is no widow period, says Thakkar.,""In India, in standard HIV testing the PCR test is not included for reasons best known to the governments both state and Centre,"" the PIL says. It adds that in 2006, NACO had announced that India was the first country in Asia to have introduced PCR.,Yet, PCR is not made mandatory at the blood banks and hospitals, it says, demanding that the authorities make it mandatory.

Almost 10 months after around 25 thalassemic children from Junagadh tested HIV+ after undergoing blood transfusion at a private blood bank at the Junagadh Civil Hospital, the Gujarat High Court on Wednesday ordered the CBI to probe the matter.,Passing the order, a division bench comprising acting Chief Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya and Justice J B Pardiwala severely criticised the state government's handling of the case while saying it was an exceptional case fit to be probed by the CBI and not by a state government agency.,The bench also came down heavily on police officer Shobha Bhutada, who had earlier probed the case, saying she was eager to get rid of the investigation ever since she was promoted assistant superintendent of police to superintendent of police.,The court expressed ""shock"" that even after an FIR was registered in the matter, the activities of the blood bank, named Sarvoday Blood Bank, were not checked despite the fact that it did not have a valid licence.,The court also pulled up the state government for allowing the blood bank, run by a trust led by a BJP MLA, to operate from the government hospital and getting itself placed among recognised blood banks on a state government website.,The blood bank ""invaded"" both the government's hospital and its website, the court observed., The blood bank's name was removed from the website only after the FIR was registered by authorities following an HC order.,""This is exceptional case. Nowhere in the history (of India) did 23 children get HIV infections at a single government hospital,"" the court said. Two of these children have already died.,The court also observed that though the complainant in the case had alleged that the blood bank was collecting lakhs of rupees, FIR registered by police made no mention of it., The court said if the CBI found it appropriate, it could modify the FIR also.,The next hearing has been kept after four weeks to see the progress in investigation. ,In February this year, the HC had ordered the state government to register an FIR in the case on the basis of a complaint lodged by the parents of the victim children. ,The court had also ordered to get the investigation supervised by a senior police officer of Deputy Inspector General of Police rank. However, it was not impressed by the police investigation.

A growing number of sex workers in the country are stepping beyond the immures of brothels and using mobile phones and Internet to solicit clients, posing a hurdle to health workers who find it difficult to identify this ""invisible group"" for HIV prevention programmes.,This came to light in a recent study by NGO Population Council which claimed that a number of factors, including a decrease in the number of people visiting brothels and the stigma attached to these areas, are increasingly driving sex workers to resort to new-age technology to contact potential clients.,""HIV intervention has taken a beating due to this emerging trend with health workers grappling to identify this 'invisible' group that mostly contacts clients using phones and Internet and draw them to lodges,"" says Niranjan Saggurti, a researcher in Population Council, who was part of the study.,HIV prevention programmes currently focus on sex workers who solicit clients from brothels, streets and highways.,The study is based on interaction with 5,498 sex workers in four states -- Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh - and was done to understand how they are soliciting clients.,A senior National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) official admitted the trend was impeding HIV prevention programmes and said an innovative measure must be drawn to identify these sex workers and spread awareness.,""We are aware of this problem. But no sex worker works in , they have peer groups and it is this link we are trying to reach out to. It is a huge challenge without doubt. We are working towards it,"" the official said.,According to the government statistics, there are an 23.9 lakh people living with HIV/AIDS in the country in 2009.,""This trend of sex workers moving away from brothels is not new, it has been happening over time. But, yes, the number has increased a lot over the last four years,"" says Rishi Kant of Shakti Vahini, an NGO working with sex workers in the capital's red-light area GB Road.,""With increasing number of sex workers leaving brothels, trafficking of minor girls has peaked,"" he says.,In the context of the study, Saggurti explains that lodges could provide an entry point for programme services to promote safe sex.,""Such a strategy to universalise condom availability in lodges as is being done in Thailand would be useful in further containing the transmission of HIV in India.,""We will take up the issue with the government and ask them to take immediate steps to identify these sex workers and ensure that HIV target programmes reach them,"" Saggurti says.

,
Is the world on the verge of ending the AIDS epidemic and creating an AIDS-free generation, even though a cure and a vaccine are still distant hopes?,Yes, roared enthusiasts among the nearly 24,000 participants at the 19th International AIDS Conference in Washington. Their hopes are based on the extraordinary scientific gains made since the conference was last held in the United States, 22 years ago, when an AIDS diagnosis was a sure death sentence.,Among those gains: antiretroviral drug combinations for women to prevent infection of their newborns; drugs to treat and prevent infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, among adults; and evidence that voluntary male circumcision can reduce the risk of female-to-male transmission by 50 to 60 percent.,Today, HIV has become a chronic disease that, if treated appropriately, can be held at bay in a newly infected young adult for decades — if the patient adheres to the rigid daily drug regimen.,Ending the AIDS epidemic is likely to be far more complicated than ending most other epidemics. The AIDS conferences, which began in 1985 to boost morale and raise aspirations of people fighting AIDS, is now more of a conventions than scientific meetings. Rhetoric is plentiful, and separating it from fact is sometimes a challenge. Lobbying for more AIDS money is a given.,One obstacle is a failure to clearly define epidemic or what it means to have an AIDS-free generation. Definitions of terms may help determine how many billions of dollars the world devotes to the battle against AIDS. A failure to meet ill-defined goals could lead to public misunderstandings that limit investments.,To begin with, defining the word ""epidemic"" is difficult. The term is flexible and subjective. Even more elusive is determining what constitutes the end of an epidemic.,AIDS makes people deathly ill from problems like severe weight loss, swollen lymph nodes and a loss of critical immune cells that increases a person's vulnerability to myriad other infections. But HIV infection can remain silent for several years before causing symptoms.,Some speakers defined an AIDS-free generation as the absence of people sick from the disease. But even if there is no one with AIDS, there will still be millions of HIV-infected people with us for a very long time. In those terms, HIV will likely be endemic until there is a cure. An AIDS-free generation, if it arrives, will live in a world where HIV very much remains a threat. ,Bill Gates, whose foundation is spending billions on developing AIDS preventions, expressed skepticism that the world could soon end the AIDS epidemic by any conventional definition. ""Unfortunately, we do not have the tools, and we need lots of new tools,"" with a vaccine the ultimate preventive one, Mr Gates told the conference.,Many participants likened ending the AIDS epidemic to medicine's successes against two other viral infections, smallpox and polio. But even Polio requires regular controlled public health efforts to stave off the disease, and it still is spread in Nigeria, Afghanistan and Pakistan. The conference participants who spoke of eradicating or eliminating AIDS failed to recognise that a vaccine was required to succeed against smallpox and polio.,US Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton told the conference that her definition of an AIDS-free generation means ""virtually no child anywhere will be born with the virus"" by 2015. People who become infected ""will have access to treatment that helps prevent them from developing AIDS and passing the virus on to others."",Under Mrs Clinton's definition, many people will continue to become HIV-infected, but not go on to suffer the myriad other infections and devastation caused by AIDS. But even if that goal is reached, millions will be living with HIV for a long time to come.

The Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) has invited criticism by asking students seeking admission to undergo HIV test.,The new academic year will begin next month. Though no student has tested positive so far, they have criticised  the move. The PMCH, however, has not issued any written order to this effect.,Students seeking admission to MBBS say that medical tests are not mandatory. ""Though medical tests are optional even at the PMCH, the administration has been insisting that all students undergo HIV test,"" said a student. ,PMCH Principal N P Yadav said, ""Though we have not issued any fresh order, we are ensuring all desirable medical examination including HIV test for students. We know these tests are not mandatory. We will take a call in case any student tests HIV positive."" ,Asked if the PMCH has any plans to segregate HIV positive students or deny them admission, Yadav said: ""No one has tested positive so far. But how can we allow HIV positive students to study with normal students? We will seek opinion of experts and see existing provisions if any student tests ,positive."",Bihar Health Secretary Sanjay Kumar said that students, irrespective of their HIV status, cannot be segregated. ""I have not heard of any such provision. I will check this with PMCH,"" said Kumar.,The other five medical colleges of Bihar have not initiated any such move.

,

,

,
,
,

,
Scientists have identified that deadly human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) spreads in the body of an infected person by 'hitching a ride' on the T cells it infects.,Researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) claimed that HIV which infects and destroys CD4-positive helper T cells also uses those cells to travel through the body and infect other CD4 T cells.,CD4 T cells direct and support the infection-fighting activities of other immune cells.,""We have found that HIV disseminates in the body of an infected individual by 'hitching a ride' on the T cells it infects,"" Thorsten Mempel from MGH Center for Immunology and Inflammatory Diseases who led the study, said. ,""Infected T cells continue doing what they usually do, migrating within and between tissues such as lymph nodes, and in doing so they carry HIV to remote locations that free virus could not reach as easily,"" Mempel said in a statement.,When HIV is introduced into blood or tissues, the virus binds to CD4 molecules on the surface of helper T cells, injecting its contents into cells and setting off a process that leads to the assembly and release of new virus particles.,It has long been assumed that these free virus travel by diffusion through tissue fluids to encounter new cells that can be infected.,Recent studies have suggested that HIV can also pass directly from cell to cell when structures called virological synapses form during long-lasting interactions between T cells.,Since CD4 T cells usually migrate quickly and form only transient contacts with other cells, the current study was designed to examine whether HIV alters the migration of infected T cells, allowing the kind of persistent contact that facilitates the spread of infection.,The team used a humanised mouse model, which has what is essentially a human immune system and is the only non-primate that can be infected with HIV.,To test the role of T cell migration in HIV infection, the researchers injected a group of humanised mice with HIV and at the same time treated them with an agent that prevents T cells from leaving lymph nodes.,Two months later, levels of HIV in the bloodstream and in lymph nodes distant from the site of injection were much lower in the treated group than in untreated HIV-infected animals, supporting the importance of T cell migration to carry virus throughout the body.

Ending the global HIV/AIDS pandemic may be possible by implementing a multifaceted global effort that expands testing, treatment, and prevention programs, as well as meets the scientific challenges of developing an HIV vaccine and possibly a cure, say researchers.,Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., Director, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Bethesda, Md., made the recommendation at a JAMA media briefing at the International AIDS Conference.,Among the most important interventions is combination antiretroviral therapy, which significantly improves the health and longevity of individuals infected with HIV. ,""Since the advent of antiretroviral therapy, the annual number of deaths due to AIDS has decreased by two-thirds in the United States. Globally, an estimated 700,000 lives were saved in 2010 alone due to the increased availability of antiretroviral therapy in low- and middle-income countries,"" Dr. Fauci and Gregory K. Folkers, M.S., M.P.H., also of the NIAID, wrote.,""Important challenges remain—notably finding the resources and developing the infrastructure to provide antiretroviral therapy to the estimated 8 million individuals with HIV infection who need these drugs but are not receiving them,"" they noted.,The researchers added that antiretroviral therapy could also prevent HIV infection by reducing the amount of virus in an infected person''s blood and other body fluids, making it less likely that the virus will be transmitted to others. Also, antiretroviral therapy is highly effective in blocking mother-to-child HIV transmission.,Other important interventions include medical male circumcision, which offers a highly effective and durable way to protect heterosexual men from HIV infection; and potentially, pre-exposure prophylaxis with antiretroviral medications, which have shown promise in reducing an individual''s risk of acquiring HIV infection.,""Each of these treatment and prevention strategies has a strong evidence base; with further refinement and scale-up and also when used in combination, they could have an extraordinary effect on decreasing the trajectory of the HIV pandemic,"" they said.,They said researchers are maintaining focus on 2 key scientific challenges that remain: the development of a vaccine and a cure. They wrote that modest success in a large-scale clinical trial of an HIV vaccine, promising results in animal models, and advances in structure-based vaccine design suggest that an HIV vaccine is feasible. The prospect of an HIV cure remains challenging.,The researchers concluded that ending the global HIV/AIDS pandemic ""will require a global commitment of resources involving additional donor countries, strengthening health care systems overall, and fostering greater ownership by host countries of HIV/AIDS effort, including investing more in the health of their people. With collective and resolute action now and a steadfast commitment for years to come, an AIDS-free generation is indeed within reach."",Their recommendation appeared in the latest issue of JAMA, a theme issue on HIV/AIDS.,

,

,
Non-disclosure of HIV serostatus to sex partners among both HIV-infected female sex workers (FSWs) and HIV-infected clients of FSWs is exceedingly common in India, researchers from Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM) in partnership with Indian researchers and HIV positive networks groups, have found.,No previous studies in India specifically, and few internationally, have assessed FSWs' and male clients' disclosure of HIV status to sex partners.,Disclosure of HIV serostatus to sex partners is viewed as a social and legal responsibility for HIV-infected individuals, particularly in the absence of condom use. In many developing countries, high prevalence of non-disclosure, ranging from 17 to 86 percent, is considered to be an important factor promoting transmission of HIV to sex partners.,Disclosure to sex partners, on average, occurs less in developing countries than in the developed world (49 vs. 79 percent respectively).,Results were based on surveys conducted with HIV-infected FSW and infected male clients regarding HIV knowledge, awareness of sex partners'' HIV serostatus, alcohol use, transactional sex involvement, post-HIV diagnosis and non-disclosure of HIV serostatus.,Non-disclosure of one's serostatus to all sex partners was reported by almost three-fifths of females and two-fifths of males according to the researchers.,Predictors of non-disclosure included lack of correct knowledge about HIV and no knowledge of sex partners' HIV serostatus. Among females, recent alcohol consumption also predicted non-disclosure. Among males, having ten (or more) paid sexual partners in the year following HIV diagnosis predicted non-disclosure.,""Disclosure is a complex decision for HIV- infected persons in India as in many other countries in the world and it may be influenced by a fear of losing clients or sex in paid or unpaid relationships,"" explained lead author Niranjan Saggurti, PhD, Co-Investigator of Alcohol Use and Sexual Risk in HIV-Infected Persons with Transactional Sex study at BUSM.,Saggurti believes that HIV prevention programs in India that seek to increase disclosure of HIV serostatus to sex partners may benefit from several factors including improving basic HIV knowledge, reducing alcohol consumption, reducing the number of different sex partners and seeking knowledge about the serostatus of one''s partner as a means to increase disclosure of HIV serostatus to sex partners.,These findings currently appear online in the journal AIDS and Behavior.

Providing antiretroviral treatment to HIV-infected individuals earlier, when their immune systems are healthier, delays AIDS-related health events like chronic herpes simplex virus and tuberculosis, as well as death, a new study has found.,Additionally, researchers found that earlier HIV treatment is also cost-effective because it increases survival, prevents costly opportunistic infections and averts transmission of the virus to uninfected individuals.,The new study was conducted by further analyses of the landmark NIH-funded treatment-as-prevention study (HPTN 052).,Initial results from the HPTN 052 study, which was announced in 2011, demonstrated that earlier use of antiretrovirals by HIV-infected heterosexuals partnered with uninfected individuals (serodiscordant couples) reduced HIV transmission by 96 percent. ,In two years of follow-up analysis of 1,761 HIV-infected study participants, researchers compared those who delayed antiretroviral treatment until their CD4+ T-cell counts were an average of 230 cells/ per cubic millimeter with those who began antiretroviral treatment sooner. ,The delayed group experienced a shorter time to a primary clinical event, including AIDS-defining disease and all types of tuberculosis. In total, there were 91 primary clinical events in the delayed treatment group versus 71 in the immediate group. ,This included 71 cases of AIDS-defining disease in the delayed treatment group versus 49 in the immediate group, and 34 cases of tuberculosis in the delayed group versus 17 in the immediate group. ,The trial provides evidence that earlier antiretroviral treatment among the HIV-infected provides significant health benefits.,In a separate modelling analysis designed to predict the clinical impact, costs and cost-effectiveness of the earlier antiretroviral treatment strategy, researchers compared the delayed treatment versus earlier treatment data in South Africa and India. ,The two countries were selected to show how regional economic differences may or may not affect the conclusions. The researchers designated earlier treatment to be ""very cost effective"" if its cost-effectiveness ratio was less than one times per capita gross domestic product (GDP). ,Earlier treatment was deemed ""cost effective"" if its cost-effectiveness ratio was less than three times per capita GDP. The GDP was set at 8,100 dollars for South Africa and 1,400 dollars for India.,Using this model, they found that in both South Africa and India early ART increases patient survival, prevents costly opportunistic infections—partially offsetting the costs of treatment—averts HIV transmission, and is cost-effective within a five-year span and very cost-effective over a lifetime.,The findings of the two analyses were presented at the XIX International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2012) in Washington, D.C.

,
Green tea and chocolates may help reduce neurological complications linked to HIV, paving way for effective treatment of HIV related brain disorders, a new study has found. ,Research by Joseph Steiner and colleagues from Johns Hopkins University found that a group of plant polyphenols known as catechins, which naturally occur in green tea and the seed of the cacao tree, may help in the prevention of these,neurological complications.,The study is published in Journal of NeuroVirology. Current drug therapy for patients with HIV is unable to control the complete replication of the virus in the brain, and, therefore, are ineffective in the complications associated with neurocognitive impairment in HIV patients.,Previous research has established the critical role of a protein called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in supporting the survival and growth of neurons in the brain. ,This protein is active in areas of the brain vital to earning, memory and higher thinking. Patients with HIV have been found to have lower levels of BDNF in their brains than healthy individuals suggesting that this could be directly responsible for the cognitive impairment suffered. ,In the study, Steiner and colleagues analysed the effects of 2000 compounds, containing both natural substances and FDA-approved drugs, on brain cells in the laboratory. ,They identified a series of compounds which had the potential to help protect neurons in the brain. Nine of these were related to epicatechin, which is found in cocoa and green tea leaves.,Further screening and comparison with resveratrol, the antioxidant found in red wine, specifically identified epicatechin and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) as being the most effective at helping protect neurons by inducing production of BDNF. ,The fact that these compounds readily cross the blood-brain barrier further increases their therapeutic potential, as this is often a major stumbling block in the development of therapies directed at the brain. ,This provides hope for patients with HIV as there is currently no neuroprotective therapy available for patients with HIV-associated cognitive impairment.

Most HIV-positive sex workers and many similarly infected clients prefer not to disclose it to their partners, according to the findings of a study conducted in Mumbai by the Network of People Living with HIV in Maharashtra, and Boston University's School of Public Health.,No specific studies in India and few internationally had so far assessed such disclosure, says the study's lead author, Niranjan Saggurti of Boston Unversity. ,Of 211 women and 205 men surveyed, all HIV-positive, 122 (58 per cent) and 84 (41 per cent) respectively did not disclose their HIV status to their partners. Over 90 per cent (194) of the women and 70 per cent (144) of the men said they were not aware of the status of any of their partners over the past 90 days, say the findings, reported online in Journal AIDS.,Disclosing one's HIV status is a complex decision, says Pune-based Manoj Pardeshi, general secretary of the people's network. The decision ""may be influenced by a fear of losing clients or sex in paid or unpaid relationships"", Saggurti agreed.,Saggurti believes programmes in India that seek to increase disclosure may benefit from factors such as improving basic HIV knowledge, reducing alcohol consumption, reducing the number of sex partners and seeking knowledge about the serostatus of one's partner. ,The study was funded by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and ICMR. It recommended that programmes have a more targeted approach to support HIV-infected populations.

It is to be noted that HIV kits need to be stored at temperature below 25 degree Celsius to stop from becoming unusable. ,According to the WBSACS, it is estimated that every year two lakh HIV kits get wasted because of the faults in the transportation system. Most of the vans used for transporting such kits lack air-conditioners. ,At Mayo Hospital too, where the kits are currently stored, there are not enough refrigerators that force the authorities to stack the kits in a room lacking temperature-controlled environment.

Concerned over the ill effects of Stavudine d4T, a first-line drug against HIV for long, the Centre plans to replace it with safer and better-tolerated Tenofovir and Zidovudine. Stavudine has been linked to high toxicity, adverse effects on cholesterol metabolism, painful neuropathy, pancreatitis, sunken cheeks and buffalo humps. ,In a joint affidavit filed in the Supreme Court Monday, the Centre and the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) said they have decided, in the wake of health concerns, to substitute Stavudine with Tenofovir and Zidovudine as the preferred first-line regimen for HIV and Hepatitis co-infection. ,The NACO, the affidavit said, has decided to shift to the new regimen in two phases — adult patients on Stavudine for 6 to 24 months will be shifted to Tenofovir or Zidovudine in phase I, which will begin in January 2013, while those undergoing this treatment for longer will be shifted in Phase II, which will start in July 2013  — as suggested by a bunch of NGOs and patient groups that have petitioned the Supreme Court to direct the government to withdraw the drug from the anti-retro-viral treatment (ART) programme and substitute it with better-tolerated drugs like Tenofovir for adults and Abacavir for children.  ,Besides, ""no new adult patient shall be initiated on Stavudine based regimen"" — new anaemic patients will be started on Tenofovir-based regimen and those who are not anaemic will be started on Zidovudine — the affidavit said. ,""Patients currently with significant toxicity to Stavudine, regardless of the length of time on Stavudine, are already being shifted to Tenofovir or Zidovudine, based on haemoglobin level,"" added the affidavit, which was recorded by a bench of Justices Swatanter Kumar and S J Mukhopadhaya.,The bench later listed the case for hearing after two weeks, awaiting another affidavit from the Centre. ,The WHO had advocated phasing out Stavudine in 2010 but the issue of pricing limited progress in this direction, particularly in India where the drug is widely used in the public-funded ART programme. ,In fact, about half of the 5 lakh patients in the ART programme are on Stavudine, so the public health implications of its phasing out are bound to be huge, not least the 25 per cent increase in the cost of the ART programme.,""No new patients are started on Stavudine since July. We have decided to replace Rs 7 per day Stavudine with Tenofovir, which costs Rs 14. It will, like Stavudine, be administered as a triple drug combo. We have placed orders for new drugs which will come by November,"" Dr B B Rewari, ART national programme officer in NACO, told The Indian Express.

US has approved a new once-a-day pill to treat HIV infection, by combining previously okayed drugs and two new ones for adults living with the deadly virus that causes AIDS.,Daily dose of the combination pill Stribild provides a complete treatment regimen for HIV infection and is meant for people who have not already been treated with other HIV drugs, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said in a statement.,""Through continued research and drug development, treatment for those infected with HIV has evolved from multi-pill regimens to single-pill regimens,"" said Edward Cox, director of the Office of Antimicrobial Products in the FDA's Centre for Drug Evaluation and Research. ""New combination HIV drugs like Stribild help simplify treatment regimens,"" Cox said.,The new pill, made by Gilead Sciences, was tested in more than 1,408 patients, in two double-blind clinical trials. Results showed between 88 per cent and 90 per cent of patients treated with Stribild had an undetectable amount of HIV in their blood, compared with 84 per cent treated with Atripla and 87 per cent treated with Truvada plus atazanavir and ritonavir.,This is Gilead's third single-tablet anti-HIV combination therapy, the company noted, adding it is still seeking approval for the newest offering in Australia, Canada and the EU.,Generic versions are being developed by a number of Indian manufacturers and the Medicines Patent Pool, a non-profit that helps facilitate generic drug-making to take the drug to developing world, where millions lack access to effective treatment options.,The drug combines previously approved Truvada that combines emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, and elvitegravir, and cobicistat.

Raj Kumar Pun took in HIV-positive orphans no one wanted, and when no one wanted to teach them either, he created a school in the shelter. But now they are running out of money, support and time.,Ten children ages 3 to 10 live in the Saphalta HIV Shiksya Sadan School, the Successful HIV Home and School, in a pink two-storey house just outside the capital of this Himalayan nation. But Pun has had to sell the building, his own house, and they must be out by the end of October.,The plan had been to rent a new building, but Pun said, ""Most people don't want to rent their house once they hear the children are HIV-infected.'' The school has two rooms where the children sleep, one room for classes and a kitchen.,Though the government provides the children's medicine, Pun, a 30-year-old high school teacher, spends nearly his entire salary covering the rest of the bills. He also teaches the children, along with friend Uma Gurung and two part-time teachers. Pun and Gurung started the shelter three years ago after reading about the children in a local newspaper. ,""Nobody wanted to take care of these children with HIV. It is not their fault that they are sick,'' said Gurung, who runs a small grocery store and has two children of her own. They travelled to southwest Nepal and came back with four young orphans. More children followed.,Government schools barely function in much of the region, and the pair quickly discovered that local private schools were unwilling to teach them. ""They even said it would be bad for their business,'' Pun said.,So he and Gurung took up the teaching duties themselves. But they cannot say where the children will learn, or even live, when the school closes.

Scientists claim to have discovered a potent compound that could boost the effects of vaccines against the flu, HIV and herpes viruses.,Research led by Oxford University team, on mice has shown that a type of polymer called polyethyleneimine (PEI) is a potent adjuvant for test vaccines against these deadly viruses.,An adjuvant is added to a vaccine to boost immune response and offer better protection against infection.,Mice given a single dose of a flu vaccine laced with PEI via a nasal droplet were completely protected against a lethal dose of flu, a marked improvement over those given the shot without PEI or in formulations with other adjuvants, the journal Nature Biotechnology reported.,""Gaining complete protection against flu from just one immunisation is pretty unheard of, even in a study in mice,"" says Quentin Sattentau, professor of pathology at the Oxford's Dunn School of Pathology, who led the work, said in a Oxford statement.,""This gives us confidence that PEI has the potential to be a potent adjuvant for vaccines against viruses like flu or HIV, though there are many steps ahead if it is ever to be used in humans,"" adds Sattentau.,When included in a vaccine with a protein from HIV, flu or herpes virus, mice subsequently mounted a strong immune response against that virus.,The immune response was stronger than with other adjuvants that are currently being investigated.,Oxford researchers now intend to test the PEI adjuvant in ferrets, a better animal model for studying flu. It is likely to be a couple of years before a flu vaccine with this adjuvant could be tested in clinical trials.,HIV, flu and herpes are some of the most difficult targets to develop vaccines against. HIV and flu viruses are able to change and evolve to escape immune responses stimulated by vaccines.,There aren't any effective vaccines against HIV and herpes as yet, and the flu vaccine needs reformulating each year and doesn't offer complete protection to everyone who receives it.,Finding better adjuvants could help in developing more effective shots against these diseases.

,

,

,
,


,
Scientists claim to have developed the first ever accurate computer simulation to explain the effects of anti-HIV drugs and remove the current 'trial and error' involved in testing new drug therapies.,AIDS experts at Johns Hopkins and Harvard universities say their model is based on specific drugs, precise doses prescribed, and on ""real-world variation"" in how well patients follow prescribing instructions.,To do so, they collected data from thousands of tests of the antiviral activity of more than 20 commonly used anti-HIV drugs.,The model, already, clarifies how and why some treatment regimens fail in some patients who lack evidence of drug resistance.,Johns Hopkins co-senior study investigator and infectious disease specialist Robert Siliciano said the mathematical model could also be used to predict how well a patient is likely to do on a specific regimen, based on their prescription adherence.,In addition, the model factors in each drug's ability to suppress viral replication and the likelihood that such suppression will spur development of drug-resistant, mutant,HIV strains.,""With the help of our simulation, we can now tell with a fair degree of certainty what level of viral suppression is being achieved how hard it is for the virus to grow and,replicate - for a particular drug combination, at a specific dosage and drug concentration in the blood, even when a dose is missed,"" said Siliciano, professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.,This information, he predicts, will remove ""a lot of the current trial and error, or guesswork, involved in testing new drug combination therapies."",Siliciano says the study findings should help scientists streamline development and clinical trials of future combination therapies, by ruling out combinations unlikely to,work.,One application of the model could be further development of drug combinations that can be contained in a single pill taken once a day. That could lower the chance of resistance, even if adherence is not perfect. Such future drug regimens, he said, will ideally strike a balance between optimizing viral suppression and minimising risk of drug resistance.,The findings will be reported in the journal 'Nature Medicine'.

As many as 200 voluntary blood donors tested HIV positive between January and July this year at state-run blood banks and laboratories. The donors were among 50,460 people whose blood samples were screened by the Central Blood Bank at Manicktala during the period. ,Significantly, the HIV positive donors are unaware of their status with the blood banks and laboratories having not informed them about their status yet, said sources. ,West Bengal has around 65 state-run blood banks. ,According to the rules of operation, the blood banks collect samples at voluntary blood donation camps and bring them to their laboratories for running mandatory tests to confirm whether the samples are clear of viruses like Hepatitis B and C and HIV. Only upon completion of such tests the blood samples are cleared for administering to patients in need. The blood banks summarily discard samples that test positive for any of these viruses. ,Dr Asit Biswas, spokesperson, health department, said he was aware of the situation, but ""we cannot tell the HIV positive patients that they are carrying the virus for fear of them being ostracised and that they will be treated with apathy"".,However, the blood safety wing of the West Bengal AIDS Prevention and Control Society sought to contradict Biswas's views in the matter. ,It said that considering the sheer gravity of the situation, blood banks ought to inform the donors whose blood samples have tested HIV positive. In states like Maharashtra, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, the donors are informed that they are carrying the virus, and that they needed treatment. ,Meanwhile, principal secretary (health) Sanjoy Mitra said he was unaware of the matter and that he will look into the matter.

A 37-yr-old Chinese man was pricked by a HIV/AIDS infected-syringe left behind at the back of a taxi in Haidan district, raising fear and concerns among commuters.,Xu Tan (name change) got pricked by a syringe while getting into a taxi in Haidan district on August 21, state media quoted the health officials as saying.,Xu felt something pierced his leg while getting into the taxi and found it to be a syringe placed in the magazine rack fixed at the back of the front seat.,According to Xu, the syringe had a needle cap, which like the syringe barrel, contained some sticky fluid.,He took the syringe to Chaoyang District Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and after few preliminary tests it was found that the fluid was HIV infected.,Jiang, a doctor at the centre's department of sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS detection, said a quick test found the fluid to be HIV antibody positive.,""Because the quick test was just preliminary the result may have been false,"" Jiang said.,The centre has submitted a sample to the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention for further tests.,According to Beijing News, Xu's blood test results were reportedly HIV negative. However, a publicity staff member at the centre said the hospital had prescribed him preventive,medications.,Ji Zhongcheng, Xu's friend who accompanied him, said Xu's doctor asked him to take regular tests in the first month.,The taxi company has refused to take responsibility, Ji said.,While Xu plans to sue the taxi company, the latter has refused to take responsibility.,Experts are cautiously optimistic about Xu's chances of not being infected with HIV.,Even if there are HIV antibodies in the fluid, it doesnt mean that the virus is definitely still alive, given that it was very fragile outside the human body, Jiang said.,Li Chaolin, president of the Chinese Foundation for Prevention of STD and AIDS, said the probability of Xu getting infected are slim.,""HIV has a lower chance of survival outside the body. If it has been outside the body for a long time, the virus may be inactivated. However, it is worth being vigilant. It will take three months to determine if he has got it.,""People who have potentially been exposed to the virus should go to standard medical institutes within 24 hours. Don't panic. Doctors will assess whether preventive medication is necessary,"" Li said.,Syringe attacks are a cause of concern in China specially after such cases reported from Xinjiang province in 2009 which witnessed ethnic strife between native Uyghurs and Chinese mainland Hans.

,
,


,
The Gujarat High Court on Thursday granted a week's time to the state government to get an expert opinion in response to a public interest litigation that seeks a change in the standard testing method for detection of HIV infection prior to blood transfusion.,The PIL has been moved by one Babubhai Thakkar, appearing party-in-person before the division bench of Chief Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya and Justice J B Pardiwala.,According to the petitioner, the present method of detecting HIV in India is 'Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)' test or the antibody test, which has a window period of three months, meaning an infection acquired in the past three months cannot be detected. ,The petition says that ELISA test can be replaced by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test where there is no window period. The petitioner has argued that PCR test was not included in the standard HIV testing in the country for reasons best known to the governments both in the state and the Centre. ,He added that in 2006, the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) had announced that India was the first country in Asia to have introduced PCR.,However, PCR is not made mandatory at blood banks and hospitals, and the petitioner has sought to make the same mandatory.,Advocate Girish Das, who is appearing in the matter, said, ""The central government and NACO have told the court that it may pass appropriate order on the petition. However, the state government has sought a week's time to seek an expert opinion over the issue."",PIL seeks change in central policy to fight HIV/AIDS,Highlighting the contradictory versions of two departments of the central government over the issue of cure of HIV infection, a public interest litigation (PIL) has been filed in the Gujarat High Court seeking change in the Centre's policy to combat HIV/AIDS.,The PIL has contended that so far, the policy has given wide publicity on the issue on the basis of a theory which says there is no cure for HIV infection and which has resulted in a social stigma for the patients infected with HIV.,A division bench of Chief Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya and Justice J B Pardiwala has issued notices to the respondents, including the central government, and kept it for further hearing after a fortnight.,According to petitioner Babubhai Thakkar, the Centre's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare includes four departments two of which are Department of Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) and Department of AIDS Control. ,Thakkar has stated that the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), which is part of Department of AIDS Control, has been mainly conducting the research and prevention programmes on HIV/AIDS. And NACO has been advertising for the past many years that HIV/AIDS is not curable and can only be prevented.,The petitioner has added that this dissemination of information has formed a particular opinion among general public on the disease and it has attached a social stigma to HIV/AIDS patients. ,He has further contended that due to this stigma, many patients are committing suicide and in rural areas they face boycott by people.,However, the Department of AYUSH of the same ministry has been of the belief that any disease can be cured, including HIV/AIDS, the PIL said. ,It added that ancient methods of medicine included in AYUSH can cure this disease but the proper information on that regard is not reaching out to the general public because NACO is concentrating mainly on the allopathic treatment.,The petitioner has sought direction to the authorities to correct the awareness drive about HIV/AIDS with emphasis on the fact that the disease can be cured with the Indian system of medicine, AYUSH, while giving details of the cured patients. ,He has also sought free treatment for all the HIV/AIDS patients.

The court of Additional Sessions Judge Kamini Lau has convicted an HIV positive man of rape, causing miscarriage and attempt to murder, holding that  knowingly passing on a sexually transmitted disease was ""an act likely to cause death"", and, hence, punishable.,The trauma of a minor girl who was repeatedly raped by her HIV positive stepfather — due to which she contracted the deadly infection — and was later forcibly given pills to cause a miscarriage, led the court to ask whether ""having sex while knowingly infected with a deadly sexually transmitted infection"" should be criminalised. ,The court sentenced the man to 10 years in jail each for the offences of rape and attempt to murder and five years' imprisonment for causing a miscarriage. ,It also imposed a fine of Rs 6,000 on him. The jail terms will run concurrently, the court said. ,The court denied the man's plea for leniency on ground of his disease, and held that ""the depravity of the convict was not only confined to sexual assault on a helpless girl, but also got compounded by the fact that despite being in the know of his HIV positive status, he committed the offence of indulging in unprotected sex with the girl as a result of which she had conceived. ,""As if this was not enough, he forcibly administered pills to her resulting in the  abortion of the foetus,"" ASJ Lau said.,The victim had told the court that after the death of her mother, her stepfather began to ""forcibly have sex with her"". ,Her plight was discovered when her younger brother was diagnosed with HIV and admitted to a local hospital. ,The girl started vomiting and was noticed by the staff there. They informed Childline and police. Later, her medical examination revealed that she had been infected with the HIV virus and was also pregnant. ,The prosecution established that the stepfather came to her hospital room in the absence of the attending nurses and administered some pills to her causing a miscarriage. ,The hospital then had to perform an abortion procedure. The DNA test of the foetus later established the convict as the father. ,The court has ordered the government to pay a compensation of Rs 2 lakh to the girl for her rehabilitation. ,The court also asked the government to consider modifying the guidelines for medical examination of accused in sexual assault cases to include tests for sexually transmitted diseases.

There is a decline in number of cases of HIV positive in the city over the past two to three years, thanks to the sustained efforts and the targeted intervention program of the Chandigarh State AIDS Control Society (CSACS), CSACS Project In-Charge Dr Vanita Gupta said at a conference held here today. As per CSACS data, adult HIV prevalence in Chandigarh has decreased from 0.5 per cent in 2003 to 0.25 per cent in 2006 and has remained at 0.25 per cent till date.,However, contrary to the averments made by the CSACS, as per the National AIDS Control Programme Phase III: State Fact Sheets of March (2012), ""The low prevalence states of Assam, Chandigarh, Orissa, Kerala, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, Jammu & Kashmir, Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya show rising trends in the last four years"".,Asked about the contradiction on the decline in number of HIV cases, Gupta said, ""The figures released by NACO are based on the estimates of 2009. Whereas as per the latest facts, the number of HIV positive cases has progressively declined. In fact, NACO will shortly release the updated figures for each state and city."",As per the NACO fact sheet of March 2012, adult HIV prevalence at the national level has continued its steady decline from 0.41 per cent in 2000 through 0.36 per cent in 2006 to 0.31 per cent in 2009. All six high-prevalence states show a declining trend. However, ""The low prevalence states of Assam, Chandigarh, Orissa, Kerala, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, Jammu & Kashmir, Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya show rising trends in the last four years."",At present, there are 292 cases from Chandigarh taking treatment from the ART Centre. Total patients on treatment at the Centre are 2,586 which includes 1101 patients from Haryana, 937 from Punjab and 164 from Himachal Pradesh. A total of 39 cases have been detected in Chandigarh from January to July 2012.,Meanwhile, to update the print and electronic media on the guidelines on reporting of HIV/ AIDS, as issued by the Press Council of India, a sensitisation workshop for journalists was organised by the Chandigarh State AIDS Control Society today.,UT Director (Public Relations) Madan Mohan Sabharwal, PCS, was the chief guest. Underlying the guidelines of the Press Council of India, he stressed the need for factual and balanced reporting of HIV/ AIDS. Scientific and statistical information with correct terminology is required to be reflected in the news reports, in consultation with experts from CSACS.

He looks a lot younger than his 12 years. He sits hands clasped, eyes downcast on a bench in the corridor of what he now calls home. ""I was always alone at home. I did have friends but their parents told them never to play with me — in case they catch the disease,'' the boy says. Then tears stream down his face. His teacher consoles him, he does have friends now.,The boy is one of 49 children at Carmel Jyoti in Manipur, for children either infected with HIV or orphaned because of it. ""We don't like to call it an orphanage, rather a care centre,"" says Sister Pauline George, the director, who runs it with three other nuns of the Congregation of Mother of Carmel, headquartered in Kerala. ,""When I visited villages for my missionary work, families would come up to me and ask me to take the children with HIV. The parents of many had died of HIV-AIDS,"" says Sister Pauline, who has been living in Manipur since 1981. ""It is only over the past six or seven years that we saw that the number of children with the disease was on the rise."",With little resources, Sister Pauline decided to open a school and a residential hostel. She got ART free from a government hospital but monthly visits from doctors in the hospital have now stopped.,""The children are very difficult to handle sometimes. They are sometimes moody and restless and can be very aggressive. The ART affects their power to focus. So they can never keep up in class with other students their age,"" she says. ,All children in the home were suffering from trauma when they came but the home has no means of dealing with this.,The 12-year-old can rattle off what ""disease"" he has, how he got it from his parents and how it is spread ""by using needles and drugs"". So can his best friend, also 12, who lost his father when he was two months old and his mother when he was barely five. He was handed over to the centre when his ageing grandfather could no longer take care of him. ""I want to join the Army when I grow up — I watch the Republic Day celebration on TV and I want to take part in the march past,"" he says. The first boy pitches in, ""I want to join the Army because I want to serve my country and my people."",According to the latest report of the Manipur Aids Control Society, the state has 2,578 HIV-positive children: 1,378 boys and 1,200 girls. Montu Ahanthem, secretary of Wide Angle, which works with HIV-positive families in the state, says the number is closer to 3,000.,""The epidemiology report of MACS has not been updated. At one stage, intravenous drug users showed the highest incidence and the virus was spreading through them. But what we have found is that mother-to-child transmission has gone up... Manipur is the state with the third highest HIV prevalence,"" says Ahanthem. He said the government and the MACS now have no schemes for HIV-positive children or widows with HIV.,Dr R K Rosie, project director of MACS, admits there is a gap in the epidemiological report and agrees there are currently no schemes for HIV-infected children. ""We did start a Prevention of Mother to Child programme several years ago and this has somewhat stemmed the spread to children. While it is better than in other states, there is still a stigma attached to children with HIV and in some cases they may even be abandoned if their parents die. It is difficult to tell whether the incidence is actually rising as many parents prefer to hide the fact."",An HIV-positive woman, 37, who lost her husband to AIDS in 2005, says their older son Ronaldo is not infected but her younger son is. ""I didn't know till many years after we married that my husband was an intravenous drug user. It was only after he died that I got myself and my sons tested. We started ART within two months,"" she says.,Like many parents in the state, she has not told her younger son about his infection. ""At the first school I went to, I informed the principal he is HIV-positive so that appropriate precaution could be taken. His admission was immediately cancelled. So naturally I never informed the second school,"" she says. Like other children infected, he is extremely aggressive, she says, and sometimes difficult to handle. ""He keeps asking me why he falls ill more often than his friends or his older brother. When I give him the ART pills he wants to know why. I simply tell him it's because of a skin disease that both of us have,"" she says. ,HIV progression in children is more rapid than in adults and one of the fallouts is that the children age faster than their peers. According to the latest NACO estimate, India has 2.4 million people living with HIV. ,,Under-15s with HIV,Maharashtra 5.52% ,Goa 4.71%,Tamil Nadu 4.10% ,Andhra Pradesh 3.92% ,Karnataka 3.59% ,Manipur 2.40% ,Nagaland	1.94%,Percentages are for HIV-infected out of total under-15 population

Poor HIV patients improve with care beyond drugs: Study,WASHINGTON: Patients stepping into Johns Hopkins University's HIV clinic in east Baltimore do not just see a doctor or get prescriptions for their anti-retroviral drugs. Many also get help finding a place to live or bus fare to make it to their next appointment. Such care that goes beyond the examination table and into patients' often challenging lives has been key to helping poorer HIV patients — particularly blacks and women — live long, healthier lives, according to a 15-year study published on Thursday in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases. Researchers at the university followed 6,366 patients in the mostly black, low-income part of a city marked by abandoned buildings and plagued by an illegal drug trade that drew national attention on the gritty television series ""The Wire."" From 1995 to 2010, doctors at Hopkins joined with social workers and other experts to treat HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS.,,Diagnosis of rare brain disorder may take months,NEW YORK: Doctors often initially misdiagnose people with Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease, a rare brain disorder caused by misfolded, infectious prion proteins, according to new research. Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease, or CJD, is marked by rapid brain wasting and dementia and typically kills patients within a year after symptoms appear. In the new study, researchers found 97 people with CJD received an average of almost four different diagnoses each before doctors made the correct call. Those alternate diagnoses included autoimmune disorders, Alzheimer's and depression. Researchers said the early symptoms of CJD can vary widely, depending on where in the brain infected proteins accumulate. ""It could be any disease that could affect the brain in a relatively rapid way,"" said Dr Richard Caselli, a neurologist from the Mayo Clinic Arizona in Scottsdale, who wrote a commentary accompanying the study in the Archives of Neurology.

A commonly prescribed anti-retroviral drug that is used long term by patients infected with HIV may contribute to cognitive impairment by damaging nerve cells, a new Johns Hopkins study has suggested.,Nearly 50 percent of people infected with HIV will eventually develop some form of brain damage that, while mild, can affect the ability to drive, work or participate in many daily activities. It has long been assumed that the disease was causing the damage, but Hopkins researchers say the drug efavirenz may play a key role.,People infected with HIV typically take a cocktail of medications to suppress the virus, and many will take the drugs for decades. Efavirenz is known to be very good at controlling the virus and is one of the few that crosses the blood-brain barrier and can target potential reservoirs of virus in the brain.,Doctors have long believed that it might be possible to alleviate cognitive impairment associated with HIV by getting more drugs into the brain, but researchers say more caution is needed because there may be long-term effects of these drugs on the brain.,""People with HIV infections can''t stop taking anti-retroviral drugs. We know what happens then and it''s not good. But we need to be very careful about the types of anti-retrovirals we prescribe, and take a closer look at their long-term effects. Drug toxicities could be a major contributing factor to cognitive impairment in patients with HIV,"" said Norman J. Haughey, Ph.D., an associate professor of neurology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.,For the study led by Haughey, researchers obtained samples of blood and cerebrospinal fluid from HIV-infected subjects enrolled in the NorthEastern AIDS Dementia study who were taking efavirenz.,Researchers looked for levels of the drug and its various metabolites, which are substances created when efavirenz is broken down by the liver. Performing experiments on neurons cultured in the lab, the investigators examined the effects of 8-hydroxyefavirenz and other metabolites and found major structural changes when using low levels of 8-hydroxyefavirenz, including the loss of the important spines of the cells.,Haughey and his colleagues found that 8-hydroxyefavirenz is 10 times more toxic to brain cells than the drug itself and, even in low concentrations, causes damage to the dendritic spines of neurons. The dendritic spine is the information processing point of a neuron, where synapses — the structures that allow communication among brain cells — are located. ,In the case of efavirenz, a minor modification in the drug''s structure may be able block its toxic effects but not alter its ability to suppress the virus. Namandje N. Bumpus, Ph.D., one of the study''s other authors, has found a way to modify the drug to prevent it from metabolizing into 8-hydroxyefavirenz while maintaining its effectiveness as a tool to suppress the HIV virus. ,""Finding and stating a problem is one thing, but it''s another to be able to say we have found this problem and here is an easy fix,"" Haughey said.,Haughey said studies like his serve as a reminder that while people infected with HIV are living longer than they were 20 years ago, there are significant problems associated with the drugs used to treat the infection.,""Some people do seem to have this attitude that HIV is no longer a death sentence. But even with anti-retroviral treatments, people infected with HIV have shortened lifespans and the chance of cognitive decline is high. It''s nothing you should treat lightly,"" he said.,The study has been described online in the Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.

The United Nations appointed Bollywood actress Aishwarya Rai Bachchan a goodwill ambassador on Monday, with a mission to help stop new HIV infections in children and promote increased access to anti-retroviral treatment.,Rai, who gave birth to baby girl names Aradhaya in November, will work with the UN program on HIV/AIDS, known as UNAIDS, advocating the ""Global plan towards the elimination of new HIV infections among children and keeping their mothers alive."",""Spreading awareness on health issues, especially related to women and children, has always been a priority for me,"" Rai said in a statement. ""And now, as a new mother, I can personally relate to this - the joys and concerns of every mother and the hopes that we have for our children."",The plan Rai will be promoting focuses on 22 countries, including India, which account for more than 90 per cent of new HIV infections among children. Of those, 21 are in sub-Saharan Africa, where the estimated number of children newly infected by HIV fell by 25 percent between 2009 and 2011, UNAIDS said.,Rai, who often features on ""most beautiful"" lists and is married to actor Abhishek Bachchan, won the Miss World crown in 1994. She went on to build a successful Bollywood career with hits such as 'Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam' and 'Devdas'.,She has also worked in Hollywood films such as 'The Pink Panther 2' and is a regular at the Cannes film festival.

Kalawati Saran Children Hospital (KSCH) has been ordered by Delhi Consumer Commission to pay Rs 10 lakh as damages to the parents of a child for transfusing HIV infected blood to him 14 years ago in his infancy.,The child hospital, affiliated to Lady Hardinge Medical College, and its doctor Ajay Kumar were held guilty by the commission of committing ""sheer medical negligence"" in giving the HIV-infected blood to the then three-day-old child.,A bench of commission's judicial member V K Gupta and member Salma Noor held the hospital guilty of negligence relying upon the documents of the medical history of the now 14-year-old boy, his parents and the expert opinion of the Medical Board of Maulana Azad Medical College.,It held the hospital and the doctor jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation.,""It was the duty of opposite party 3 (Dr Kumar) and 2 (hospital) to examine the blood to come to a certainty that it does not contain any HIV infection. The transfusion of the blood to the patient is not in dispute. Obviously, there is a sheer medical negligence on the part of the opposite parties 2 and 3 in not examining and ensuring that the blood does not contain any HIV infection.,""Initially the patient had the ailment of diaphragmatic hernia and his operation was conducted on June 12, 1998 when he was three-day-old and on account of medical negligence, he now has the ailment of HIV.,The commission ordered payment of damages to the boy's parents saying the tenager has been subjected to a deadly disease.,""It is a matter of common observation that it is a very serious disease and a person having this ailment cannot survive long. We hereby direct opposite parties 2 and 3 to pay Rs 10 lakhs as compensation for mental agony and harassment to complainants (parents), inclusive of litigation charges and it shall be their joint and several liability,"" the bench said.,The commission's order had come on a complaint by the child's parents, residents of Delhi, who had said that their son was never free of ailments subsequent to his treatment at the KSCH in 1998 and on tests at Safdarjung Hospital here, he was diagnosed with HIV in January 2006.,They had said their son had undergone surgery at the KSCHfor diaphragmatic hernia and during the procedure 150 ml of blood was transfused to him.,The blood had been procured from the blood bank of Sucheta Kripalani Hospital, which too is affiliated to Lady Hardinge Medical College, they had said.,In its defence, the hospital had contended that the blood was procured from the blood bank of the medical college which had conducted necessary screening and testing of the blood.,The hospital had added that only HIV negative blood had been transfused into the infant, so there was no question of negligence and carelessness on its part.

A deadly Salmonella strain epidemic has swept across the whole of Africa by ""taking advantage"" of the spread of HIV, an international study has found.,It is thought to be the first time a single strain of an infection has spread so widely in the wake of the virus.,The study, first to identify the separate cases as a single epidemic, found that one in four people in Africa infected with the strain had died.,Cases of this form of invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella have been recognised in Africa for more than a decade. It causes fever, headaches, respiratory problems and sometimes death, a media report said.,Researchers analysed the genetic code of 179 batches of Salmonella from different parts of Africa and the rest of the globe.,Using techniques similar to a large-scale DNA paternity test, they were able to construct the strain's ""family tree"" and then how it spread.,""It quite clearly parallels the emergence of HIV in Africa,"" Prof Gordon Dougan, from the Sanger Institute in Cambridge in the UK, said.,HIV attacks the immune system and leaves people more vulnerable to other infections. It is thought the strain of Salmonella Typhimurium took advantage of this weakness to spread.,Researchers said the bacterium was given the chance to ""enter, adapt, circulate and thrive"".,There is poor monitoring data for the disease across the whole of the continent, but Dougan said it was affecting ""thousands and thousands"" of people and that 98 per cent of adult cases were in people with HIV.,The study is published in the journal 'Nature Genetics'.

To break the barriers of ignorance, fear and stigma, Samvad HIV Helpline was started in 2005 with one line and one counselor. Seven years later, they have dealt with 1.10 lakh genuine callers and have set up the largest helpline for people with HIV.,The helpline is operational in Maharashtra, Bihar, Jharkhand and Ahmedabad. Till date Samvad has reached out to over 1 lakh 30 thousand life people. Most of the callers are from the aged between 15 and 40, said Dr Madhu Oswal of the Muktaa Charitable Foundation. About 2.4 million people in India, aged between 15 and 49 have HIV/AIDS, the third largest with prevalence rate of is 0.31 per cent. Of these, an estimated 39 per cent are women and 3.5 per cent are children.,Callers are mostly students. With the AASHA and Sampark service we are getting more number of calls from women, illiterate and rural population, Oswal said.,In next 5 years, MCF plans to start similar service in other states such as Gujarat, Rajasthan, Orissa, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Delhi and West Bengal. Its other initiatives include Ankur (systematic disclosure of their HIV status to children living with HIV), AASHA (initiative to enhance adherence to HIV drugs in patients), Sampark (Free mobile service to helpline for rural and illiterate people), Call back service for desperate callers and SMS reminder service for ART refill.,MCF plans to add Tuberculosis helpline to the existing HIV helpline by the year end. Tuberculosis alone causes 1,000 deaths a day.,In India oral cancer has taken an epidemic form. MCF plans to train general practitioners in Pune in oral cancer and tobacco de-addiction. Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai has agreed to be the academic partner in the initiative.  Volunteers, donors and NGOs are appealed to contact the helpline at Samvad HIV Helpline 020-26381234.

A 22-year-old mistook an HIV negative report for having AIDS and hanged himself to death with a nylon rope at his workplace in Madhopur near Pathankot on Tuesday night. The deceased, Jinten Pal left a suicide note  — purportedly written by him in a mix of Punjabi, Hindi and English — where he said that he suspected that he had AIDS. ,""I Jinten Pal, son of Tarsem Lal, want to say that I have AIDS,"" reads the suicide note. ""I am committing suicide and I am not much educated"". ,Seeking an apology for his act, Jinten further wrote that those who might have any suspicion relating to him should also get an HIV test done. ,The inquiry official in the case, Deepak Kumar said that Jinten committed suicide due to his ignorance and fear as one of Jinten's work associate, at a previous work place, was HIV positive. ,Jinten gave a passing reference to the person in his suicide letter including mentioning the employer from whom this associate acquired the disease. Jinten, however, maintained that he (Jinten) did ""no wrong thing"". ,""The person about whom Jinten talked about in the note is AIDS patient. Jinten was not aware how AIDS spreads and thought that he had acquired the disease from this associate,"" Kumar said. ,Neither police nor the family members of Jinten have so far been able to trace the HIV test report, which Jinten mentioned. ,""We have no idea from where he got the test done,"" Kumar said. ,Jinten's father, Tarsem Lal, who works as a physical training instructor in a school after retiring from the Army said that he came to know of the suicide on Wednesday morning. ""The police broke open the door and found Jinten hanging,"" said Tarsem Lal. ,Jinten's employer Gora, as he is called in the area, said that he had been working with Jinten for the last eight years. Gora described Jinten as a gentle and hardworking person, ""For the past fortnight or so he was somewhat depressed and saying that he was not keeping well,"" he added.

Driven out of her home at Indapur in Pune district after her husband died due to AIDS and she tested positive for HIV, she regained her confidence after 14 days of counselling at Vanchit Vikas's community care centre in Pune. She has today been welcomed back by her family. ,The community care centre (CCC), however, was shut down last week. ""We just do not have funds to help look after the people living with HIV anymore,"" says Meena Kurlekar, coordinator. The ten-bed CCC had been funded for the last three years by Karnataka Health Promotion Trust (KHPT).,The Pune centre looked after 1,760 people living with HIV. Two or three hours' drive away from Pune, the Snehalaya community care centre at Ahmednagar is struggling.,CCCs have been part of the National AIDS Control Programme since 2008. Each of the 350 CCCs in the country was required to have 10 beds and the programme was funded by Global Fund via NACO. Maharashtra and Karnataka had 96 centres, but since last year there has been no scale-up and today there are only 54 in the two states, 26 of them in Maharashtra.,At Snehayalaya, founder Dr Girish Kulkarni protested the shortage of funds and managed to get an extension till March next year. ""We have 1,860 people living with HIV at our institution. A grant of Rs 16-18 lakh to run a 10-bed centre is provided each year under the CCC project. We have helped people with HIV rebuild their lives,"" says Kulkarni. ,At the 250-bed Bel Air Hospital at Panchgani, which runs a community care centre, director Father Tomy Kariyilakulam too said they were not getting funds. ""However, we are committed to treating extremely sick patients,"" says Father Tomy. ""It is the care and support given to people living with HIV that really help them pick up the threads of life."",""The stigma against people with HIV still prevails. At our centre we not only provided basic medical treatment but also offered them hope for a better life. Some even met their future life partners here and got married,"" says Kurlekar, adding it is impossible to run a centre with no funds.,Dr Mrunal Shetye, project director of KHPT, admitted there are no funds and most of the centres have been given an extension only till March next year. Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society project director Ramesh Deokar said a final evaluation of the CCCs is under way.,Dr Anwar Parvez, NACO regional coordinator (HIV care, support and treatment), Maharashtra and Goa, said a new strategy was being worked out where treatment would be handled by ART centres while some of the existing CCCs could continue as care and support centres.

Cows' milk can be potentially developed into affordable creams that can help protect humans against HIV, a study has claimed.,Lead scientist from University of Melbourne Marit Kramski found that when pregnant cows were vaccinated with an HIV protein, the first milk produced by the cow after giving birth, called colostrum, produced high antibodies to protect its newborn against disease.,Researchers were now planning to test the effectiveness and safety of the milk before turning it into a cream which will hopefully allow women to protect themselves against contracting the virus during sex, without relying on men, the Herald Sun reported.,However, the final result could be a decade off.,The researchers were able to inhibit the virus from infecting cells when combing the virus cells with milk.,""We think the antibodies bind to the surface of the virus and blocks the protein which needs to be freed to get in contact with human cells - like a key and lock system. If the key's not accessible or you change the key, you can't open the door,"" Kramski said adding ""It's a very cheap and easy way to produce a lot of antibodies."",Kramski had partnered with Australian biotechnology company Immuron Ltd to develop the milk, and would continue working with them to produce a preventative cream.,""We have the antibodies at the moment - the next step will be formulation,"" Kramski said.,Condoms were ""cheap and easy"" but not an option for everyone with millions of people getting infected with HIV every year, she added.,""A lot of women, especially in Africa or South America they don't have the power to say you need to use a condom before we have sex.,""This milk looks like it can be a cheap, easy new prevention tool, because if you use drugs it's really expensive,"" she said.

The HIV-AIDS lab at Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research here has found that HIV-1 virus has been undergoing viral evolution in India over the past decade and possibly in other parts of the world.,The scientists found the emergence and expansion of three to five new strains of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type I rapidly replacing the standard viral strain, according to a press release on 'Emergence and expansion of variant viral strains of HIV-1 in India and other global regions'.,The discovery has been published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry by the group led by Prof Ranga Uday Kumar of Molecular Biology and Genetics Unit of JNCASR.,""The study is the first of its kind to identify that a major family of HIV-1 undergoing an evolutionary modification,"" the JNCASR release said.,The work consisted of an active collaboration with several research institutes and hospitals that specialise in HIV management.,The YRG Centre for AIDS Research and Education (YRG CARE), Chennai, St. John's National Academy of Health Sciences, Bangalore, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurological Sciences Bangalore, and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi took part in the research.,Scientists from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, the USA also participated.,""The new viral strains appear to contain a stronger viral promoter,"" the release stated,In the lab experiments, the new HIV strains make more daughter viruses as compared to the standard viral strains. Additionally, people infected with the new HIV strains seem to contain more virus in their blood.,The data has been generated from  individual hospitals from different parts of the country. The clinical findings have been substantiated by a quantum of laboratory experiments using viral, immune and molecular strategies.,A similar process of viral evolution has also been observed in other countries such as South Africa, China and Southern Brazil. All these countries have the same family of HIV-1 as India.,""It is, however, critical to understand that the experimental data are generated only through a cross-sectional (i.e. from a single time point), not a longitudinal, analysis,"" the release said. ,""The data therefore should be considered only as suggestive but not conclusive. In fact, the scientists believe that the new viral strains of HIV are smarter in making more daughter viruses thereby improving their chances of transmission to new hosts but they are not likely to be promoting faster development of AIDS,"" it stated.,JNCASR is presently making arrangements to collaborate with five other research institutes in India (YRG CARE, Chennai, National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai, St John's Hospital, National AIDS Research Institute, Pune and AIIMS) to conduct an observational clinical study.,It will examine if the new HIV strains are indeed more infectious in the clinical setting and if they are likely to modulate disease progression to AIDS.,""The study raises several questions with serious implications for the viral fitness, evolution and disease management. The most important of all the concerns is the possibility that the new HIV strains altering the landscape of the HIV demographics in India,"" it said.

,
The secret of the fresh spate of ""mysterious"" deaths in Batala is now out. An observation report filed by a team of doctors from the Amritsar Government Medical College into the fresh set of deaths in Batala's Gandhi camp area has stated that these deaths could have occurred due to drug abuse and HIV. ,After over 20 gastroenteritis related deaths that took in the Gandhi camp from September 29 till October 15, followed by another 17 deaths due to ""unknown reasons"", the focus is now back on this slum known in Gurdaspur as the hotbed of drugs and alcohol. ,The two-page report submitted by the team to Secretary Anajli Bhawara (Medical Education and Research) stated that the deaths reported after October 17 do not point towards any fresh outbreak of gastroenteritis and other causes of death should also be kept in mind keeping in view the immune status of persons residing in the area and rapid drug abuse. ,As the outbreak was due to faecal contamination of piped water supply, so there is likelihood of cases of hepatitis A and E surfacing in the near future due to their incubation period of up to 50 days. During the interaction with health and administrative authorities, it was advised to have a regular house-to- house survey to detect the early appearance of hepatitis and to established the cause of illness, it added. It was also submitted that other aspects of drug addiction and substance abuse should also be curtailed, which makes a person more vulnerable to die even with a small intercurrent infection. ,The Gandhi camp, with a population of over 10,000, is one of the several drug bazaars in the state where procuring alcohol and pharmaceutical drugs for abuse is a child's play. Locals allege an open nexus between the police, politicians, chemists and the drug peddlers who have made Gandhi camp a breeding ground for drug addicts. ,Sources said that other than drug addicts who are hooked to synthetic drugs and pharmaceutical drugs, there are at least 400 HIV-positive people living in the camp and on any given day, three to four deaths are reported from the area. Groups of young boys squatting in hooded corner in the bylanes of the Gandhi camp, injecting themselves exchanging needles is a common sight. In the morning, people wake up to used injections, cough syrup bottles strewn in the streets, said a local.,Sources added that normally, deaths in Gandhi camp go unreported, as these are deemed to be natural deaths. But after the government announced a compensation of Rs 1 lakh to the next of kin who died due to gastroenteritis, almost every death was being reported to the local civil hospital. ""We have made it compulsory to conduct the postmortem of every person who died of suspected gastroenteritis. The families, which bring in the dead to the hospital from Gandhi camp claim that their patient died after severe gastroenteritis problems. But when we insist on getting a postmortem done, they refuse. We have reasons to believe that many normal deaths are being reported as gastroenteritis deaths,"" said Director (Health Services) Dr Ashok Nayyar. ,When contacted, Gurdaspur Deputy Commissioner Dr Abhinav Trikha said: ""The gastroenteritis outbreak has been controlled and no fresh cases reported. Alcohol abuse is quite high in the area and there are chances that the normal death rate in the camp area is high.""

,

,

,
,
,

,
Scientists have developed a new ten times cheaper ultra-sensitive sensor test to detect the early stages of several cancers and viruses, including HIV, with the naked eye.,Researchers from the Imperial College London claim that their visual sensor technology is ten times more sensitive than the current gold standard methods for measuring biomarkers.,These indicate the onset of diseases such as prostate cancer and infection by viruses including HIV. The colour of a liquid changes to give either a positive or negative result.,Researchers say their sensor would benefit countries where sophisticated detection equipment is scarce, enabling cheaper and simpler detection and treatments for patients.,The team tested the effectiveness of the sensor by detecting a biomarker called p24 in blood samples, which indicates HIV infection.,""Unfortunately, the existing gold standard detection methods can be too expensive to be implemented in parts of the world where resources are scarce,"" Professor Molly Stevens, from the Departments of Materials and Bioengineering, said.,""Our approach affords for improved sensitivity, does not require sophisticated instrumentation and it is ten times cheaper, which could allow more tests to be performed for better screening of many diseases,"" said Stevens.,Researchers also tested samples for the biomarker called Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), which is an early indicator for Prostate Cancer. The team say the sensor can also be reconfigured for other viruses and diseases where the specific biomarker is known.,The sensor works by analysing serum, derived from blood, in a disposable container. If the result is positive for p24 or PSA, there is a reaction that generates irregular clumps of nanoparticles, which give off a distinctive blue hue in a solution inside the container.,If the results are negative the nanoparticles separate into ball-like shapes, creating a reddish hue. Both reactions can be easily seen by the naked eye.,The team also said that the sensor was so sensitive that it was able to detect minute levels of p24 in samples where patients had low viral loads, which could not be diagnosed using existing tests such as the Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) test and the gold standard nucleic acid based test.,""We have developed a test that we hope will enable previously undetectable HIV infections and indicators of cancer to be picked up, which would mean people could be treated sooner,"" researcher Roberto de la Rica, said in a statement.

,

,

,
,
,

,
About half of HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy skipped their medications whenever they were drinking alcohol, according to a U.S. study - an ill-advised behavior that researchers say could lead to higher viral loads.,The study, published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine, for a year followed nearly 200 people with HIV who were on antiretrovirals and drank alcohol. It found that 51 percent stopped taking their medications while drinking.,Lapses could be due to forgetfulness while under the influence, but a widespread - and erroneous - belief that mixing alcohol and HIV drugs can be toxic appears to play a role.,The harms caused by missing their medications far outweigh the harms caused by mixing the two, if the person doesn't have liver disease, said Seth Kalichman, a professor at the University of Connecticut and lead author of the study.,Drinking has been known to interfere with people's adherence to their medications, but researchers said the consequences of inconsistent use of HIV medications can be more severe.,Antiretroviral drugs suppress the HIV virus, and patients must take the medications continuously to prevent the virus from surging. Additionally, going on and off the drugs can lead to drug resistance.,People living with HIV who deliberately stop their medications when they are drinking are at risk for treatment failure, the researchers wrote.,Kalichman and his colleagues surveyed 178 people - about four out of five of them men - who were currently using antiretroviral therapy and reported that they drank alcohol.,At the beginning of the study, the researchers asked the participants about their alcohol-related beliefs, such as whether they thought their drugs wouldn't work as well if the two mixed. They also asked whether people would not take both at the same time, either by avoiding alcohol or the medicines.,Over the following year, the team checked in with patients every month to see how well they were sticking to their prescriptions through a pill count, and every other month they called to ask how often the patient had been drinking recently.,Doctors' offices measured each patient's level of virus and measures of immune system health.,They found that 51 percent of the patients would avoid the medications when they drank, and half of the people in this group had poor adherence to their prescriptions. In addition, half of the group that skipped pills said they wouldn't take them again until the alcohol was out of their system.,People who skipped medications while drinking were also more likely to have higher levels of HIV in their bodies and lower numbers of CD4 cells, a measure of immune system health.,I think it's pretty well demonstrated that alcohol use is tied to poor adherence, and I think most people think it's because they're impaired in some way or they forget... whereas here it shows they're (often) intentionally missing their medications, said Catherine Grodensky, a researcher at the Center for AIDS Research at the University of North Carolina.,And it looks like it's having some significant impacts on their treatment.

Thein Aung has been trained not to show weakness, but he's convinced no soldier is strong enough for this.,He clenches his jaw and pauses, trying to will his chin to stop quivering and his eyes not to blink. But he's like a mountain that is crumbling. His shoulders shake, then collapse inward, and he suddenly seems small in the denim Wrangler shirt that's rolled up to his elbows and hanging loosely off his skinny arms. Big tears drip from his reddened eyes, and he looks away, ashamed.,As he sits outside a crowded clinic on the outskirts of Myanmar's biggest city, he knows his body is struggling to fight HIV, tuberculosis and diabetes - but he can't help wishing he was sicker.,Although Aung is ill enough to qualify for HIV treatment in other poor countries, there are simply not enough pills in Myanmar. Only the sickest of the sick are lucky enough to go home with lifesaving medicine here. The others soon learn their fate is ultimately decided by the number of infection-fighting cells found inside the blood samples they give every three months.,The World Health Organization recommends treatment start when this all-important CD4 count drops to 350.,In Myanmar, it must fall below 150.,Antiretroviral therapy, in the past considered a miracle only available to HIV patients in the West, is no longer scarce in many of the poorest parts of the world. Pills are cheaper and easier to access, and HIV is not the same killer that once left thousands of orphaned children in sub-Saharan Africa.,But Myanmar, otherwise known as Burma, remains a special case. Kept in the dark for so many decades by its reclusive ruling junta, this country of 60 million did not reap the same international aid as other needy nations. Heavy economic sanctions levied by countries such as the United States, along with virtually nonexistent government health funding, left an empty hole for medicine and services. Today, Myanmar is among the hardest places to get HIV care, and health experts warn it will take years to prop up a broken health system hobbled by decades of neglect.,""Burma is like the work that I did in Africa in the'90s. It's 15, 20 years out of date,"" says Dr. Chris Beyrer, an HIV expert at Johns Hopkins University who has worked in Myanmar for years. ""If you actually tried to treat AIDS, you'd have to say that everybody with every other condition is going to die unless there are more resources."",Of the estimated 240,000 people living with HIV, half are going without treatment. And some 18,000 people die from the disease every year, according to UNAIDS.,The problem worsened last year after the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria canceled a round of funding due to a lack of international donations. The money was expected to provide HIV drugs for 46,500 people.,But as Myanmar wows the world with its reforms, the U.S. and other nations are easing sanctions. The Global Fund recently urged Myanmar to apply for more assistance that would make up the shortfall and open the door for HIV drugs to reach more than 75 percent of those in need by the end of 2015. It would also fight tuberculosis, a major killer of HIV patients. TB in Myanmar is at nearly triple the global rate as multi-drug resistant forms of the disease surge.,The aid group Doctors Without Borders has tried to take up the slack by providing more than half the HIV drugs being distributed. But every day, physicians at its 23 clinics must make agonizing decisions to turn away patients like Aung, who are desperately ill but still do not qualify for medicine because their CD4 counts are too high.,""It's very difficult to see those kind of situations,"" says Kyaw Naing Htun, a young doctor with a K-pop hairstyle and seemingly endless energy, who manages the organization's busy clinic in Insein. He says about 100 patients who should be on drugs are turned away every month in Yangon alone. ""It takes a lot more resources when they come back sicker. It's a lose-lose game."",Aung first learned about the virus living inside him in April. He had dropped weight and wasn't sleeping well, but figured it was the TB and diabetes running him down.,When the test came back positive for HIV, he was shocked and scared: How? Why?,""I wanted to commit suicide when I found out the results,"" he says softly, looking away. ""What upset me most was my wife. She says I shouldn't die now because we have children."",The questions swarmed and consumed him, followed by a flood of worry and guilt that he had possibly infected his spouse. Then the bigger concern: What's next?,Unlike many living in a country closed off to the world for the past half century of military rule, Aung, an Army staff sergeant, had some firsthand knowledge about HIV.,He had watched the disease rot one soldier from the inside out, punishing him with a cruel death. But he also saw another get on treatment and live a normal life, despite the military kicking him out.,With the images of those two men locked in his head, Aung decided to fight to save himself and ultimately his family. No one but his wife could know, or he would lose his job and their home on the military base because of the deep fear and discrimination surrounding the disease. Drugs were his only chance to keep the secret.,""If I get the medicine, and I can stay in this life longer, I will serve the country more and my family will not be broken,"" he says. ""My family is invaluable."",At the clinic in Insein, an area of Yangon better known for a notorious prison, Aung, who is using another name to protect his identity, waited nervously for the results of his first blood test.,CD4 count: 460. Low enough for drugs in the U.S., but well above the 150 cutoff in Myanmar. He was given TB medication and told to come back in three months.,Many of the 200 people crammed into the two small buildings of an HIV center just outside Yangon are simply waiting to die.,Beloved opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi visited patients there in November 2010, just days after being freed from house arrest, appealing to the world for more medicine. She also spoke passionately in July about the stigma of HIV via a video link to the International AIDS conference in Washington, saying, ""Our people need to understand what HIV really is. We need to understand this is not something that we need to be afraid of."",There are no doctors or nurses stationed at the hospice supported by Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party, forcing patients to care for each other. One man hangs a drip bag on a plastic string from the ceiling over an emaciated body. Other caregivers - many of whom are also infected - wave paper fans beside their loved ones for hours, providing the only relief they can offer.,Infected children whose parents have already died play barefoot in the stuffy, crowded rooms. Bodies, some nothing more than breathing corpses, are stacked side by side on bamboo slats above dirt floors.,Another room is packed with 20 women stretched out on straw mats crisscrossing the wooden floor. A young mother sobs in one corner as she breast-feeds a 7-day-old baby girl. She did not take HIV drugs until late in her pregnancy, and now must wait up to 18 months to know for sure whether her only child is infected.,""The funding is limited for the enormous number of patients,"" says newly elected parliament member Phyu Phyu Thin, who founded the center in 2002 and was jailed by the former government for her HIV work. ""Waiting to get the medicine under the limits is too risky for many patients because they can only get it when their health is deteriorating."",Aung looks the part of a soldier with his shaved head and wiry build. He spent the first decade of his 27 years in the military fighting in domestic ethnic wars, away from his wife and two children.,It's this past life that devours him each night when sleep refuses to come. He served as a medic then, and regularly came into contact with the blood of wounded soldiers. He also had sex with other women. The question that haunts him most is, which one is to blame? He'll never know.,He takes sleeping pills every night to be released from these thoughts. But relief does not come, as chills and night sweats drench his body and the constant urge to urinate keeps him running to the toilet.,He's lost 10 pounds in the past month, dropping from 130 pounds to 120. His cheeks are starting to sink, and his eyes look hollow. His strength is also fading, and he can no longer lead grueling daily runs with the trainees. He uses his TB as an excuse, but he fears his superiors will not be fooled much longer.,""I try to hide it as much as I can, but some people have started rumors about me, so I try not to face them directly,"" he says. ""I want to be strong like the other people. I'm trying, but now my body cannot follow my mind."",His wife refuses to be tested until Aung gets on the drugs. She worries if she comes back positive, her guilt-ravaged husband will kill himself.,""She doesn't want me to be depressed,"" he says. ""If she is positive, I will be very, very depressed."",The disease has forced him to rethink who he is. He's killed people in combat, cheated on his wife and witnessed many horrors in his lifetime. But he wants a chance to make up for his wrongs.,As a Buddhist, he believes his disease is a punishment for misdeeds in a previous life. He vows to be a better man by helping others and giving what little he has to charity.,He says sicker patients deserve treatment first. Still, as he sits waiting for his second blood test, he can't help wishing his immune system was weak enough to help him reach the magic number.,But when the doctor reads his results, he knows he will leave empty-handed again.,CD4 count: 289. Still too high.,His only choice is to try again in three months, hoping he'll be sick enough then.

,

,

,
,


,
A nationwide health survey in jails has found 80 of Chhattisgarh's prisoners HIV-positive, out of 13,000-odd tested. Prison authorities insist that the inmates had probably arrived already infected, but health authorities don't rule out the possibility that it was after being jailed that they got infected, with unsafe sex or drug use the likely causes.,This has turned into a contentious issue. The health authorities are contemplating distribution of condoms and syringes, but the jail authorities say there is no reason to do so. Their resistance comes apparently because allowing distribution of condoms would amount to an acceptance of the fact that homosexuality exists in jails.,The 80 found HIV-positive include women prisoners too. ""This is the first instance of an ELISA test being conducted in jails anywhere in India. Figures for none of the other states are available,"" said S K Binjhwar, additional project director, Chhattisgarh Aids Control Society.,""Of these 80 prisoners, 65 have a CD4 count less than 350. They are being given ART. So far we have tested only those we suspected to be from a high-risk group, but since the infection also spreads to others in jails we are expanding our sample size,"" he said. ""We counsel them about safe sex."",The jail administration says the health authorities should focus on sources of infection beyond prisons. ""Instead of focusing on jails, the health authorities should focus on red-light areas and drug addicts and on improving the health situation at village level, especially checking quacks who use old syringes. These are the major sources of spreading HIV infection,"" said ADG (jail) Giridhari Nayak.,""A jail has a mobile population, like a train. People board at a station and get off at the next. Only a few remain till the final destination,"" Nayak added. ""Of the total HIV-positive inmates in Chhattisgarh jails, only 12 are convicts while the rest are undertrials; they keep getting released and new ones come in. The infection comes from outside; it is not spreading in jails."" ,Dr K K Gupta, Raipur jailor, said that the possibility of homosexual behaviour in jails ""is merely hypothetical"". Gupta said, ""There is no question of distributing condoms or syringes as such activities are yet to be seen in jails."",Homosexuality in jails has been discussed globally and opinions have been sharply divided. A California study notes that the rate of HIV prevalence among people who are incarcerated is nearly seven times higher than that of the general population. San Francisco jail authorities installed a condom-vending machine on their premises after HIV infection was found to be rapidly spreading in the area in the 1990s. ,In Chhattisgarh, the project began in March 2011, when the state AIDS control society decided to conduct ELISA tests in jail and contacted the authorities. From April 2011-March 12, 6,082 inmates underwent the test and 54 were found positive. From April 12-August 12, 7,304 were tested with 26 found positive.

,
With 7-10 per cent of HIV positive persons developing resistance to drugs after being treated, the National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) is planning to set up a database on drug resistance patterns and is also opening its doors for conducting clinical trails for developing vaccines for other viral diseases. ,""Life expectancy of  people with HIV has increased owing to Anti Retroviral Treatment (ART) but the new drug resistance patterns that are emerging are a cause for concern,"" NARI director Dr R S Paranjape told The Indian Express. Ahead of World AIDS Day (December 1) Paranjape said the number of people living with HIV may have stabilised across the country and was unlikely to dip further. ,This is mainly because people with HIV now have access to ART and are living longer. ""What is of concern is that there is no Indian algorithm for the interpretation of these cases of drug resistance and thus an Indian database was needed, Paranjape explained. ,""We are also seeing HIV-associated cancers and till now, not much information is available on this subject. NARI has conducted and completed a study that looks at persons living with HIV and also persons with cancers from the Indian registry.  We want to understand how many persons got cancer after being detected with HIV and the results are being evaluated,"" Paranjape said. ,As per WHO data, HIV prevalence has declined from 0.41 per cent in 2000 and 0.36 per cent in 2006 to 0.31 per cent in 2009 in India. There are an estimated 2.3 million people living with HIV in the country today. Adult HIV prevalence at a national level has declined notably in many states, but variations still exist. ""States with a low prevalence of HIV such as Orissa, West Bengal and Gujarat, are showing an increasing trend and the challenge is to deal with newer issues such as containing the HIV infection among the population of migrant workers, men having sex with men, injecting drug users and unorganised sex workers,"" Paranjape said. ,Between 2011 and 2015, the World AIDS Day theme will be 'Getting to zero: Zero new HIV infections. Zero discrimination. Zero AIDS related deaths.' Paranjape, who was officiating NARI director since 1998 before being appointed full-time in 2006, said scientists were more optimistic today about newer treatment for HIV and on new technologies that can help contain the epidemic.

The National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) and B J Medical College (BJMC) have undertaken a project to 'test-and-treat' HIV-infected women who have a higher risk of getting cervical cancer.,The study at both NARI and BJMC will look for a better way to prevent cervical cancer in women who have HIV and also high-risk Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) by comparing immediate cryotherapy to a Pap test-based strategy. This study will also see if these methods are safe and tolerable in HIV-infected women. ,NARI Director Dr R S Paranjape told The Indian Express, ""The test-and-treat programmes using visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) linked to cryotherapy have been shown to be effective methods of cervical cancer prevention in several countries and now studies are also being taken up here."",Two separate projects under the same AIDS Clinical Trials group network and funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), USA will be part of a multi-centre study to compare different methods to prevent cervical cancer in HIV-infected women. ,Worldwide, November is being observed as month to create awareness about prevention of cervical cancer which has emerged as the largest killer, surpassing breast cancer. Studies at NARI have also shown that there was an alarming increase in the prevalence of high-risk HPV among HIV-infected women and hence a need was felt to catch these women early to prevent cervical cancer.,Dr Sheela Godbole, principal investigator of the study at NARI, told The Indian Express that HPV is the virus that usually causes cervical cancer. Some types of HPV are more likely to cause cervical cancer than others. ""We will screen over 200 HIV-infected women to check whether they have HPV and then try to get rid of it by using cryotherapy to freeze the cells,"" Godbole explained. NARI has tied up with Bharati Vidyapeeth's hospital to conduct the cryotherapy procedure.,Women with the high-risk types of HPV virus in their cervix will be randomly assigned to one of two different approaches to prevent cancer, test-and-treat, said Dr R Bhosale, principal investigator for the trial at B J Medical College. ,During cryotherapy, cells in the cervix that have HPV high-risk virus will be frozen and killed. The standard approach involves two procedures to check for cancer cells in the cervix: Pap test and biopsy. For the Pap test a sample of cells is collected from the cervix and looked at under a microscope. If there are signs of abnormal cells, a small piece of cervical tissue (biopsy) is removed to be examined closely. If the biopsy shows abnormal cells, procedure LEEP will be done to remove abnormal cells, said scientists.

,
The Gujarat High Court on Thursday directed the central government to constitute a body of experts to examine as to what extent Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test could be made mandatory at blood banks across the country for detection of HIV infection within two months.,Acting on a public interest litigation (PIL), a division bench of Chief Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya and Justice J B Pardiwala directed that the committee will place its report before the court three months after its constitution and posted the matter for May 2013.,The PIL has contended that the standard method for detecting HIV in India is 'Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)' test or the antibody test, which has a window period of three months. This means an infection acquired in the past three months cannot be detected. However, the ELISA test can be replaced by PCR test where there is no window period.,According to the PIL, in India, PCR test was not included in the standard HIV testing for reasons best known to the governments both at the state and the Centre. It has been added that in 2006, the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) had announced that India was the first country in Asia to introduce PCR.,However, PCR is not made mandatory at blood banks and hospitals, and the petition has sought to make the same mandatory.,As the PCR test is costlier than the ELISA test, the court observed, ""...we would like to make one aspect very clear that when we are dealing with the subject of life of a citizen, the cost should not be a factor so far as the government is concerned."",""It is the duty of the government to protect the life of its citizens and it would not lie in the mouth of any government to say that because of cost factor, the PCR Test is to be ruled out. Life is priceless,"" it further observed.

,
After nearly two decades of being one of the most feared diseases in the world, the rate of new HIV infections and deaths due to AIDS have gone down, reveal figures released by the World Health Organisation ahead of World AIDS Day.,In 2011, 2.5 million people were newly infected with HIV and an estimated 1.7 million people died — which makes 700,000 fewer new infections worldwide than 10 years ago, and 600,000 fewer deaths than in 2005, WHO said in a statement, attributing much of the progress to the advent of anti-retrovirals that decrease the chances of the infection being passed on to someone. ,However, the cost of the medication remains a matter of concern. ""Many countries are facing economic difficulties, yet most are managing to continue expansion of access to antiretroviral medicines,"" said Dr Gottfried Hirnschall, Director of WHO's HIV Department. ,""The 2015 target (getting the HIV infected on anti-retroviral medication) looks more achievable now than ever before."",Currently 8 million people in low-and middle-income countries are accessing the treatment they need, up from only 0.4 million in 2003. ,""The challenge now is to ensure that global progress is mirrored at all levels and in all places so that people, whoever they are and wherever they live, can obtain antiretroviral therapy when they need it,"" added Dr Hirnschall.,Access to the medicines, however, is limited for children with only 28% of those who need medication under drugs. ,Adolescent girls, sex workers, men who have sex with men and people who use drugs often remain vulnerable and marginalised. ,Earlier this year, the WHO issued guidelines for treating people with HIV who have uninfected partners — the organisation now recommends offering antiretroviral therapy to the HIV-positive partner, regardless of the strength of his or her immune system, to reduce the likelihood of HIV transmission to the uninfected partner. ,Some countries are also considering initiating treatment at an even earlier stage in the course of HIV, and by offering all HIV-positive pregnant women antiretroviral therapy for life. ,WHO is currently reviewing new scientific research and country experiences in order to publish updated and consolidated guidance on the use of antiretrovirals in mid-2013.

A new vaginal microbicide gel could be highly effective in blocking infection by the AIDS virus, a new study has claimed,Researchers led by Dereuddre-Bosquet from the European Combined Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Microbicides (CHAARM) Consortium describe the gel's key ingredient, which are small peptides engineered to present a decoy to bind up the virus and prevent it from entering and infecting the body cells.,Because this is a gel it can be topically applied and could represent a powerful preventative agent against sexual transmission of HIV.,The scientific community, worldwide, is working on the development of a vaccine against HIV. To date, few treatments that block virus entry have shown promising protection.,Research is also focused on the reduction of the spread of the virus by the application of a microbicide gel to protect users during intercourse which is a time of first exposure to virus.,Bosquet and colleagues engineered peptides named ""miniCD4s"" because they mimic the CD4 receptor used by HIV to gain entry into immune cells of the body.,The study shows that the miniCD4s blocks HIV entry into isolated cells in a dish and tissue models that mimic mucous membranes which are points of virus entry.,The authors then formulated miniCD4s at 0.3 per cent in a microbicide gel that was vaginally applied to six female cynomolgus macaques monkeys for one hour before the animals were given a high dose of the virus also in the vagina.,This dose would ordinarily make the animals prone to infection but instead, five of the six were completely protected from HIV infection. No trace of virus was found in any body tissue.,They were also unable to detect any antibodies to the virus in the plasma of the animals, indicating that the virus was completely repelled and there was full protection.,This study provides a proof of principle that for a promising strategy for the prevention and protection against HIV transmission during sexual intercourse.,Importantly, the protection was demonstrated in a non human primate model which represents an essential step prior needed to progress to a prospective clinical trial.,The study was published in the journal PLOS Pathogens.

,

,

,
,


,
A newly discovered gene that is essential for embryo survival could also hold the key to treating and potentially controlling chronic infections such as HIV, hepatitis and tuberculosis, scientists say.,The gene, called Arih2, is fundamental to the function of the immune system - making critical decisions about whether to switch on the immune response to an infection.,Its discovery has implications for the treatment of chronic overwhelming infections, such as Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), that 'exhaust' and switch off the immune system, as well as for chronic inflammatory (also known as autoimmune) conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis,and sepsis, said researchers from Walter and Eliza Hall institute in Australia and the University of Toronto, Canada.,Researcher Dr Marc Pellegrini said that Arih2 is found in dendritic cells, the sentinels of the immune system that play an essential role in raising the alarm about the presence of foreign invaders in the body.,""Arih2 is responsible for the most fundamental and important decision that the immune system has to make - whether the immune response should be initiated and progressed or whether it should be switched off to avoid the development of chronic inflammation or autoimmunity,"" he said.,""If the wrong decision is made, the organism will either succumb to the infection, or succumb to autoimmunity,"" Pellegrini said in a statement. ,He explained that although our immune system works well against many infections, some organisms have developed mechanisms to evade or counteract the immune system, allowing them to persist in the body.,""During evolution, some organisms have evolved ways of exhausting our immune system to the point where the immune system just switches off, and this is what happens in HIV, hepatitis B and tuberculosis,"" he said.,""These organisms counter the immune response – exhausting T cells which are stimulated over and over again by the infection and becoming exhausted or paralysed. With this current discovery, what we should be able to do is circumvent these mechanisms and reinvigorate the immune response temporarily to boost the immune system and help clear these infections,"" he said.,Researcher Dr Greg Ebert said the team was now looking at the effect on the immune response of switching off Arih2 for short periods of time during chronic infections. ,""We are investigating how manipulating Arih2 and associated pathways promotes immunity in chronic overwhelming infections, where we know the immune response is inadequate,"",Ebert said.,Pellegrini said it would take many years to translate the discovery to a drug that could be used in humans.,The study was published in the journal Nature Immunology.

More than half of young people in the United States who are infected with HIV are not aware of it, according to a report by government health officials that zeroes in on one of the remaining hot spots of HIV infection in America.,Young people ages 13 to 24 account for 26 percent of all new HIV infections, according to the report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which was released on Tuesday in advance of World AIDS Day on Dec. 1.,Given everything we know about HIV and how to prevent it in 30 years of fighting the disease, it's just unacceptable that young people are becoming infected at such high rates, CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden said on a conference call with reporters.,Every month, 1,000 young people in America become infected with HIV, an incurable infection that costs $400,000 to treat over a lifetime, Frieden said. If left untreated, HIV infection leads to AIDS and early death., The data are stark and worrying, Dr. Kevin Fenton, director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB Prevention at the CDC, said in a telephone interview.,In 2010, 72 percent of the estimated 12,000 new HIV infections in young people occurred in young men who have sex with men, and nearly half of new infections were among young, black males.,We are particularly concerned about what is happening with HIV among young black gay and bisexual men, Fenton said. They account for 39 percent of all new infections among youth and more than half of new infections among young men who have sex with men.,  Fenton said the proportion of young people infected with HIV has remained relatively stable during the last few years, but infection rates appear to be increasing in these populations., And because many of the newly infected gay or bisexual males are just beginning to explore their sexuality, stigma and homophobia are making HIV testing and treatment far more challenging.,Although the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend routine screening for HIV starting in the early teens, too few young people are getting tested, Frieden said.,Only 13 percent of all high school students and only 22 percent of sexually active high school students have ever been tested for HIV, the CDC found.,The figures for young adults aged 18 to 24 are not much better, with only 35 percent of people in this age group reporting ever having been tested for HIV.,Frieden said one reason for the higher rates of infection among young gay and bisexual men of all races was a higher rate of risky behaviors compared with their heterosexual peers., According to the report, a large analysis of risk behaviors among high school students revealed that gay and bisexual males are much more likely to have multiple sex partners, to inject illegal drugs and to use alcohol or drugs before sex. They are much less likely to use condoms., And because so few get tested, HIV-infected people under age 25 are significantly less likely than those who are older to get and stay in care, and to have their virus controlled at a level that helps them stay healthy and reduce their risk of transmitting HIV to partners.,The CDC also found that many young men who have sex with men are less likely than others to have been taught about HIV or AIDS in school., We have to correct a lot of myths and misconceptions, Frieden said. It is astonishing the level of ignorance about basic physiology that may high school and middle school students have.,To address some of the issues, the CDC is funding a program  that targets both at-risk youths and the homophobia and stigma in the community that drives them underground.,In September, Georgia, a state where new HIV infections among those 13 to 24 years old exceed the national average - accounting for as many as one-third of all new HIV infections - won a grant as part of a pilot project to find better ways of targeting these at-risk youth., We think that it's really critical that the discussions we have about HIV prevention and access to HIV become fully integrated into the social fabric of the youth culture, Dr. Melanie Thompson, of the Georgia Department of Public Health, said in a telephone interview.,Care and Prevention in the United States, known as CAPUS, is a three-year program led by the CDC and other government agencies aimed at reducing HIV and AIDS among racial and ethnic minorities in the United States. It focuses on addressing social, economic, clinical and structural factors influencing HIV health outcomes.,It is a huge challenge, said Thompson, but I think if we do this from the point of view of trying to end an epidemic that is decimating our young people, and do it in a way that is science-based, I think we can make progress.

In a bid to check resistance to anti-HIV drugs, the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) had two years ago appealed private practitioners treating HIV patients to report each case but the response has been poor, revealed Dr B B Rewari, national programme officer, NACO to The Indian Express. ,Two years ago, following a directive of the apex court, NACO had written to Medical Council of India to direct private doctors to report details about HIV patients being treated either on first- or second-line drug regimen. ""This was done to contain increase in resistance to drugs, in the private health sector,"" Rewari said. ,MCI had written to state medical councils to direct doctors treating HIV patients to report each case to NACO to check prescriptions recommended for anti retroviral therapy. ,According to Rewari, initially a small database was prepared but two years later there has been virtually no response from private practitioners. ""Since HIV is not a notifiable disease, NACO officials admitted they could not take the project further beyond appeals to doctors.""  ""However, there are 42 second-line ART centres that have been set up and more have been planned to ensure patients who have not responded to first-line drugs can get treatment,"" Rewari said. ,While NACO will officially make an announcement in the decline in HIV  prevalence, Rewari said there has been a significant decrease and the percentages are likely to come down. Out of 2.3 million people with HIV, we have reached out to 5.6 lakh who are presently on ART.  More than 5,000 people are being given second line of ART. There has also been a drop in number of HIV-TB co-infection cases. Out of an estimated 14 lakh TB infections, at least 90,000 have HIV, he said. ,According to Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society project director Ramesh Deokar, 578 integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTCs) in the state have referred 90,817 persons to check for TB under the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP). Till September this year, 1,290 TB patients in the state were diagnosed with HIV and 36,407 TB patients were referred to ICTCs for checking for HIV. The focus now is on preventing the disease among men having sex with men (MSM), migrant workers and injecting drug users (IDUs).

Scientists have discovered that a cancer drug may be useful in purging latent HIV infection by activating the virus and making it 'visible' to drugs that can treat the condition.,In a report published in the Journal of Leukocyte Biology, researchers used cell lines that contained latent HIV, as well as cells from patients who were on potent antiretroviral therapy with no detectable virus in their blood.,Researchers then added the cancer drug, JQ1, to latently infected cells, at physiologic concentrations, and observed potent reactivation of latent HIV.,The study observed potent suppression of inflammatory genes in genome-wide expression studies using the same cells.,JQ1 reactivation of latent HIV may make it vulnerable to current therapies, researchers believe.,""This drug may be useful as adjunctive therapy in efforts to purge latent HIV reservoirs to eradicate infection,"" said Monty A Montano, principal investigator from Boston University Medical Campus.,""This drug functions synergistically with other HIV purging agents,"" Montano said in a statement.,""One thing that's been made clear by the decades of HIV research is that there is no magic bullet for curing this disease,"" said John Wherry, Deputy Editor of the Journal of Leukocyte Biology.,""Rather, the progress that's been made has been a series of incremental steps that often build on other previously developed therapies.,The hope is that the ability of JQ1 to make latent HIV 'visible' to other HIV drugs described in this report will be another cog in the gearwheel of an HIV cure,"" Wherry said.

After a decline in the number of new HIV infections this year within the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits, the civic health department is planning to set up HIV testing facilities at 10 civic hospitals. However, in Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) there has been a slight increase in detection of HIV cases this year.,Dr Rajeev Bamble, nodal officer, Pune State AIDS Control Society (PSACS), told The Indian Express that 72,555 persons were tested at 17 Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs) till October this year and 2,471 of them tested positive. ,In 2011, there were 3,745 new HIV infection cases, down from4,440 new HIV cases registered at ICTCs across the city 2010.,Of 994 boys below 14 years, 45 tested HIV positive, while out of 792 girls, 37 tested positive, Bamble said. Among 113 transgenders tested from January till October this year, 9 tested positive for the virus.,There has been a significant drop in the number of new cases, Bamble said. While the HIV detection rate was more than 10 per cent in 2005 at ICTCs, it has now dropped to 3.4 per cent, Bamble said. ,The rate of transmission from mother to child has also declined. According to Dr S T Pardeshi, acting chief medical officer of PMC, surveillance measures have been stepped up to keep up with the Getting to Zero theme this World AIDS Day. ,Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) has given the go ahead to start counselling and testing for HIV and we will receive test detection kits soon.,When contacted, Dr Anand Jagdale, PCMC health chief, said due to their consistent efforts to create awareness about HIV prevention and testing, there has been a slight rise in the number of detections at the four ICTCs. ,According to PCMC officials, out of an estimated 7,000 people (who mainly belonged to high-risk category) tested at ICTC centres from April to October this year, 575 were detected HIV positive. From March 2011 to April 2012, of an estimated 15,000 persons, 994 were detected positive at PCMC ICTC. ,A series of programmes have been organised on December 1, including a rally by college students and others and will commence from Goodluck Chowk at Deccan Gymkhana. More than 50 dispensaries of PMC and hospital staff will participate in programmes to create awareness about HIV prevention. ,Apart from conducting exhibitions and displaying posters at various civic hospitals from December 1-15, street plays and a counselling session will be held Yerawada Central Prison.

The presence of migrant sugarcane farmers and a thriving commercial sex industry makes Karad tehsil off the Mumbai-Pune-Bangalore highway a high-prevalence HIV pocket — and it is here that a new rural research initiative is being launched on World AIDS Day tomorrow.,For the first time, Pune-based National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) will extend its activities to the rural and semi-urban pockets of the state.,The NARI-AIDS Rural Research Initiative in Maharashtra (NARRIM) is an extension of the Pune-based institute's activities in rural areas, NARI director Dr R S Paranjape told The Indian Express. He pointed out that HIV and AIDS continued to outpace response, especially in rural areas.,Maharashtra was one of the earliest states to be affected by HIV/AIDS, and one of the first to be considered a high-prevalence state. The state sees considerable in-migration, and 32 of its 35 districts are labeled 'Category A', indicatind a high prevalence of HIV and AIDS.,Also, while 72 per cent of Indians live in rural areas, where the estimated HIV prevalence is only slightly lower than in urban areas, awareness levels in the villages are precariously low, Dr Rajat Goyal, country director of International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) and one of the funding partners of the project, told The Indian Express.,The Indian Council of Medical Research has sought to reach out to rural areas, and a corpus of around Rs 1 crore has been built for the Karad initiative. Karad taluka was chosen due to its strategic location adjacent to NH-4, which sees massive inter- and intra-district migration, and is on a busy truckers' route.,The initial phase of the project will last 18 months. There will be tie-ups with communities, consultations with local stakeholders, and formation of advisory and regulatory bodies at the sites. Rapid assessments and counseling for HIV prevention would be carried out, Dr Goyal said.,These steps will help to map the 'hotspots' and high-risk populations in the area, and facilitate the understanding of the socio-behavioural and cultural determinants of HIV infection and prevention preparedness in the community.

Ahead of World AIDS Day on Saturday, a  study has revealed that children living in orpahnages are better equipped physically and emotionally to tackle HIV as compared to those part of extended families. ,The survey by the paediatric department of Sion Hospital compared five HIV+ children with an average age of 8 living with extended families and five with an average age of 10 living in an orphanage. ,""We were surprised to find children in the orphanage were better looked after. They were better groomed to understand the illness and take charge of medication,"" said Mamta Manglani, HOD. ,""Children living with extended families were discriminated against and showed signs of social isolation,"" she said.  The children studied are patients from different parts of the country being treated at Sion Hospital ART Centre. ,The study will now be extended to 100 children to understand implications of environment among HIV+ orphans.   Meanwhile, even as national figures showed a drop of about 50 per cent in fresh HIV cases this year, mother-to-child transmission was a worry, officials said.  ,Hospitals have registered a 9-10 per cent rate of transmission, much above the ideal 2 per cent.  ,""The only way to beat mother-to-child transmission is early detection of the disease. With proper treatment at the right time, transmission can be prevented,"" said Amol Wankhede, joint director dat Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society.

In a first, on the occasion of World AIDS Day on Saturday, the HIV Testing and Disease Monitoring laboratory in the Department of Immunopathology, PGIMER has been accorded Accreditation by the National Accreditation Board for Calibration and Testing Laboratories (NABL). ,NABL is a central agency which has laid down certain guidelines (known as NABL 15189:2007) based on international standards of laboratory set-up and functioning and grants accreditation (certification) following a very stringent criteria of assessment made by independent NABL certified assessors. ,The PGI HIV laboratory is not only the first in Chandigarh but also in the whole of north India beyond New Delhi in a government setup to get NABL accreditation. ,The laboratory boasts of giving HIV diagnostic and disease monitoring (CD4 count and viral load) services as per international standards and the report generated from this laboratory will be acceptable in any country around the world following such standards. Since the services are fully sponsored by NACO (Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Govt of India), the HIV testing and CD4 count are offered free of cost in this laboratory to the patients inflicted with this disease. Dr Sunil Arora, Professor and In charge of this laboratory insists that anybody desiring to know his/her HIV status should avail these services in ICTC, PGI, Chandigarh. ,The NABL assessment involves the functioning of the index laboratory related to all aspects including competency and training of authorized signatory and technical staff, functional status and calibration of all instruments, up-to-date documentation of all activities including maintenance of a quality manual, bio-safety manual, standard operating procedures (SOPs) and management review committee meetings. This kind of systematic work culture is not normally seen in government hospital/institute laboratories in India. ,The laboratory in PGI which got this distinction, started as a HIV screening center under the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) HIV sero-surveillance program way back in 1987. ,But the laboratory scope increased manifold over the years since the inception of the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) in 1992 taking over the responsibility of making HIV control and management policies in India, when the laboratory was termed as 'Voluntary Confidential Counseling and Testing center (VCTC) which was later re-designated as the Integrated Counseling and Testing center (ICTC) with the start of ante-natal screening program. ,The laboratory is also NACO designated State Reference Laboratory (SRL) as it is looking after the training and quality assurance of all the HIV testing laboratories (ICTCs, PPTCTs and Blood bank labs) in the Union Territory of Chandigarh.

A new HIV test which provides a preliminary result within 30 minutes, using only a finger prick of blood, has been approved for use in Australia.,The test, developed by medical diagnostics company and approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration for marketing in Australia, will lead to quicker treatment and reduce the risk of sufferers passing on the virus, Health Minister Tanya Plibersek said.,The test requires only a finger prick of blood which is transferred to a test card, the 'Sydney Morning Herald' reported.,The card, in turn, detects the presence of HIV antigen and antibodies in the blood sample.,The test will be processed while the patient waits, whereas laboratory tests typically take over a week and can take as long as three months.,It is a preliminary screen only and all positive results require confirmation by a laboratory test. Plibersek said she hoped the test developed by Alere would encourage people at risk of HIV infection to be tested more regularly.,""Rapid testing is being used internationally to ensure that people newly infected with HIV can quickly access treatment. That means better health for the patient and a lower risk of passing on the virus,"" said Plibersek.,The executive director of the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations, Rob Lake, welcomed the approval of the test, which he said would increase the level of testing and enable earlier diagnosis.,""Making HIV testing simpler and more accessible for gay men, the most affected community in Australia, will help make the testing experience easier and encourage them to test more often,"" he said.,There have been 31,000 HIV infections, more than 10,000 cases of AIDS and more than 6000 deaths from AIDS in Australia since 1985. An estimated 24,731 people were living with HIV in Australia at the end of 2011, the report said.

Children of parents who are beneficiaries of disability, old age or widow pension as well as those whose annual income is below Rs 1 lakh are also included in the group. ,However, children of parents whose annual income is less than Rs 35,000 will be given priority. If the seats are still vacant after accommodating all such children, then priority will be decided by a list prepared in the ascending order of the annual income of parents having an annual income of more than Rs 35,000. ,The parents suffering from cancer and HIV will have to submit suitable medical certificate for the admission of their children. For homeless children, the tehsildar will certify the status, whereas the other categories will have to attach their respective income or caste certificates along with their forms. ,The government has also decided that only in case the students of these sections are unable to get admission in state government-owned or aided schools because of scarcity of seats, will these students be admitted to private unaided schools. In order to grant admission in private schools, the district Basic Education Officer will get a proposal approved from the respective district magistrate within five working days of the application moved by the parents. ,The basic education officer has also been instructed to regularly review the students admitted under the category and ensure that the seats vacated due to drop-outs are filled up soon. The officer will also have to put the details of payment made to the schools against the education of these students online. ,The arrangements will be implemented by the state government from the academic session 2013-14. The publicity of the scheme will be done two months in advance of the beginning of the session, said the order. ,Under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act 2009, every child of the age of six to fourteen years has a right to free and compulsory education in a neighbourhood school till completion of elementary education. Under the Act, 25 per cent seats in private schools are to be reserved for the children belonging to weaker and disadvantaged sections of the society, the cost of which is to be borne by the state and central governments.

Increasing number of youths indulging in unsafe sex has resulted in 13,500 HIV positive cases being reported in Haryana. ,According to official figures, among the total of 16,700 HIV positive cases reported in the state, over 13,500 cases have been contracted due to sexual transmission. HIV cases spread through blood transmission and use of infected needles have been significantly low, comprising only 10 per cent of the cases in Haryana. ,Among these 13,500 cases, nearly 12,000 involve youths between 25 to 49 years of age. While 6,816 cases involve those between 25 to 34 years, those between 35 to 49 years have been affected in 5,255 cases. On the contrary, only 1,257 HIV positive cases have been reported among people who are above 50 years old. ,Additional Project Director of Haryana State AIDS Control Society (HSACS), Dr Vijay Garg, said: ""The government is promoting the use of condoms to keep a check on HIV positive cases. The percentage of positive cases when compared to the overall population of the state is only 0.1 per cent. We are better off than the other states in terms of prevalence of positive cases."" ,Joint director of HSACS, Ram Kumar, added: ""Besides supplying free condoms to government hospitals, we also take sell contraceptives at cheaper rates to private chemists. Nearly 60 lakh condoms have been used in the state last year and the government is seeking to promote more usage."" ,Garg, however, said the positive side of the story was that while transmission of HIV from pregnant women to newborns was declining. ""The mode of transmission through pregnancy is low and has infact stablised,"" he said, adding that HSACS was promoting condom usage among homosexuals and female sex works — identified as high risk groups for the transmission of disease. ,According to official figures, there are 334 HIV positive homosexuals in the state.

A city-based diagnostic clinic has been ordered by a consumer forum here to pay Rs 2.05 lakh as damages to a 25-year-old youth for wrongly diagnosing him as HIV-positive and depriving him of an employment opportunity abroad.,The South West District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum ticked off Paramount Diagnostic Centre saying that it was ""not only negligent but also rash"" in declaring Delhi resident Mohd Dilshad unfit instead of confirming its report through fresh tests.,""If the test conducted by the opposite party (Paramount) had to be re-run after four to six weeks to confirm it then the lab could not have reported him unfit on the basis of their (initial) findings... Their haste in declaring him unfit immediately after the test is not only negligent but also rash on their part,"" the bench presided by Narendra Kumar said.,The forum also noted that Paramount's report had been proved ""false"" by all subsequent tests including one by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) which was conducted within two weeks of the ""faulty"" report.,""This faulty report resulted in deprivation of employment to complainant who was a young job seeker of 25 years of age,"" it said and directed the clinic to pay Dilshad Rs two lakh as compensation for loss of job and reputation along with Rs 5,000 as litigation cost.,Dilshad in his plea had said that he was required to undergo a fitness test after clearing his interview for the job of electrician in a Saudi Arabian company and as per his employer's directions he had visited the diagnostic centre on October 4, 2010 for undergoing the fitness test.,The clinic in its report said he had tested positive for HIV I and II and declared him unfit for the job, Dilshad said adding that when he got his blood tested at four other labs, including AIIMS, the results came back negative for HIV.,The lab in its defence has said it was going to hold the tests again after four to six weeks to confirm the results and had followed the proper procedures for conducting such tests.,The forum, however, rejected the contention saying the defence taken does not mitigate the lab's liability.

,
A  baby born with the HIV virus that causes AIDS appears to have been cured, scientists announced Sunday, describing the case of a child from Mississippi who's now 2 and has been off medication for about a year with no signs of infection,There's no guarantee the child will remain healthy, although sophisticated testing uncovered just traces of the virus' genetic material still lingering. If so, it would mark only the world's second reported cure.,Specialists say Sunday's announcement, at a major AIDS meeting in Atlanta, offers promising clues for efforts to eliminate HIV infection in children, especially in AIDS-plagued African countries where too many babies are born with the virus.,""You could call this about as close to a cure, if not a cure, that we've seen,'' Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health, who is familiar with the findings, told The Associated Press.,A doctor gave this baby faster and stronger treatment than is usual, starting a three-drug infusion within 30 hours of birth. That was before tests confirmed the infant was infected and not just at risk from a mother whose HIV wasn't diagnosed until she was in labor.,""I just felt like this baby was at higher-than-normal risk, and deserved our best shot,'' Dr. Hannah Gay, a pediatric HIV specialist at the University of Mississippi, said in an interview.,That fast action apparently knocked out HIV in the baby's blood before it could form hideouts in the body. Those so-called reservoirs of dormant cells usually rapidly reinfect anyone who stops medication, said Dr. Deborah Persaud of Johns Hopkins Children's Center. She led the investigation that deemed the child ""functionally cured,'' meaning in long-term remission even if all traces of the virus haven't been completely eradicated.,Next, Persaud's team is planning a study to try to prove that, with more aggressive treatment of other high-risk babies. ""Maybe we'll be able to block this reservoir seeding,'' said Persaud.,No one should stop anti-AIDS drugs as a result of this case, Fauci cautioned.,But ""it opens up a lot of doors'' to research if other children can be helped, he said. ""It makes perfect sense what happened.'',Better than treatment is to prevent babies from being born with HIV in the first place.,About 300,000 children were born with HIV in 2011, mostly in poor countries where only about 60 percent of infected pregnant women get treatment that can keep them from passing the virus to their babies. In the U.S., such births are very rare because HIV testing and treatment long have been part of prenatal care.,""We can't promise to cure babies who are infected. We can promise to prevent the vast majority of transmissions if the moms are tested during every pregnancy,'' Gay stressed.,The only other person considered cured of the AIDS virus underwent a very different and risky kind of treatment - a bone marrow transplant from a special donor, one of the rare people who is naturally resistant to HIV. Timothy Ray Brown of San Francisco has not needed HIV medications in the five years since that transplant.,The Mississippi case shows ""there may be different cures for different populations of HIV-infected people,'' said Dr. Rowena Johnston of amFAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research. That group funded Persaud's team to explore possible cases of pediatric cures.,It also suggests that scientists should look back at other children who've been treated since shortly after birth, including some reports of possible cures in the late 1990s that were dismissed at the time, said Dr. Steven Deeks of the University of California, San Francisco, who also has seen the findings.,""This will likely inspire the field, make people more optimistic that this is possible,'' he said.,In the Mississippi case, the mother had had no prenatal care when she came to a rural emergency room in advanced labor. A rapid test detected HIV. In such cases, doctors typically give the newborn low-dose medication in hopes of preventing HIV from taking root. But the small hospital didn't have the proper liquid kind, and sent the infant to Gay's medical center. She gave the baby higher treatment-level doses.,The child responded well through age 18 months, when the family temporarily quit returning and stopped treatment, researchers said. When they returned several months later, remarkably, Gay's standard tests detected no virus in the child's blood.,Ten months after treatment stopped, a battery of super-sensitive tests at half a dozen laboratories found no sign of the virus' return. There were only some remnants of genetic material that don't appear able to replicate, Persaud said.,In Mississippi, Gay gives the child a check-up every few months: ""I just check for the virus and keep praying that it stays gone.'',The mother's HIV is being controlled with medication and she is ""quite excited for her child,'' Gay added.

Australian researchers today claimed to have moved a step closer in finding a cure for HIV by successfully luring the 'sleeping' virus out of infected cells.,According to a statement released by the Melbourne-based Alfred Hospital, researchers have shown that the cancer drug vorinostat alters how HIV genes are turned on and off and in effect wakes up 'sleeping' virus, which is otherwise not eliminated in patients undergoing standard HIV treatment.,Director of Infectious Diseases at the hospital, Sharon Lewin said the results from the study are very promising and nearly all patients who took vorinostat showed that the virus could be woken up.,""We know that the virus can 'hide' in cells and remain out of reach of conventional HIV therapies as well as the immune system,"" Lewin said.,""Anti-HIV drugs are unable to eradicate the virus because it burrows deeply into the DNA of immune cells, where it gets stuck and goes to sleep. Anti-HIV drugs are effective in keeping people healthy but they cannot eliminate a virus that is sleeping. The results will now inform the design of further studies to find a way to possibly cure HIV.,""We wanted to see if we could wake the virus up – and using vorinostat we have successfully done that. This is a very important step but the results of the trial have raised further questions. After waking up the virus, we now need to work out how to get rid of the infected cell. A kick start to the immune system might help,"" Lewin added.,""We have an enormous amount still to learn about how to ultimately eradicate this very smart virus,"" she said.,Twenty HIV-positive patients in Victoria were the first in the world to participate in a trial of two weeks of vorinostat.,The research, in collaboration with The Alfred Hospital, Monash University, Burnet Institute, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre and the National Association of People Living With HIV/AIDS, is part of a global effort to find a cure for the virus, and was presented at the 20th Annual Conference on Retrovirus and Opportunistic Infections in Atlanta.

Kate Kelland,,Treating people with HIV rapidly after they have become infected with the virus that causes AIDS may be enough to achieve a ""functional cure"" in a small proportion of patients diagnosed early, according to new research.,Scientists in France who followed 14 patients who were treated very swiftly with HIV drugs but then stopped treatment found that even when they had been off therapy for more than seven years, they still showed no signs of the virus rebounding.,The research, published in the journal PLoS Pathogens, follows news earlier this month about a baby girl in Mississippi in the United States being effectively cured of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) after receiving very early treatment.,Christine Rouzioux, a professor at Necker Hospital and University Paris Descartes and a member of the initial team who identified HIV 30 years ago, said the new results showed the number of infected cells circulating in the blood of these patients, known as ""post-treatment controllers"", kept falling even without treatment for many years.,""Early treatment in these patients may have limited the establishment of viral reservoirs, the extent of viral mutations, and preserved immune responses. A combination of those may contribute to control infection in post-treatment controllers,"" she said.,""The shrinking of viral reservoirs... closely matches the definition of 'functional' cure,"" she said.,A functional cure describes when the virus is reduced to such low levels that it is kept at bay even without continuing treatment. The virus, however, is still detectable in the body.,Most of the some 34 million people with HIV across the world will have to take anti-AIDS drugs known as antiretroviral therapy for the whole of their lives. These drugs generally keep the disease in check but also have side effects and a high cost impact on health systems.,Worldwide, the number of people newly infected with HIV, which can be transmitted via blood and by semen during sex, is falling. At 2.5 million, the number of new infections in 2011 was 20 percent lower than in 2001, according to the United National AIDS programme (UNAIDS). And deaths from AIDS fell to 1.7 million in 2011, down from a peak of 2.3 million in 2005.,Asier Saez-Cirion, a senior HIV researcher at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, said that although most patients will not be able to control HIV, these results suggest that at least some may be able to if they get treatment early enough.,""(This data) and the Mississippi study strongly support early treatment initiation and may hold important clues for the development of a strategy to cure HIV or at least induce a long-term control without the need of anti-retroviral treatment,"" he said.

,
ANDREW POLLACK & DONALD G McNEIL Jr,,Doctors announced on Sunday that a baby had been cured of an HIV infection for the first time, a startling development that could change how infected newborns are treated and sharply reduce the number of children living with the virus that causes AIDS.,The baby, born in rural Mississippi, was treated aggressively with antiretroviral drugs starting around 30 hours after birth, something that is not usually done. If further study shows this works in other babies, it will almost certainly be recommended globally. The United Nations estimates that 330,000 babies were newly infected in 2011, the most recent year for which there is data, and that more than three million children globally are living with HIV.,If the report is confirmed, the child would be only the second well-documented case of a cure in the world. That could give a lift to research aimed at a cure, something that only a few years ago was thought to be virtually impossible, though some experts said the findings in the baby would probably not be relevant to adults.,The first person cured was Timothy Brown, known as the Berlin patient, a middle-aged man with leukemia who received a bone-marrow transplant from a donor genetically resistant to HIV infection.,""For pediatrics, this is our Timothy Brown,"" said Dr Deborah Persaud, associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Children's Center and lead author of the report on the baby. ""It's proof of principle that we can cure HIV infection if we can replicate this case."" ,The findings were presented at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Atlanta on Monday. The results have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed medical journal. ,Some outside experts said they needed convincing that the baby had truly been infected. If not, this would be a case of prevention, something already done for babies born to infected mothers.,""The one uncertainty is really definitive evidence that the child was indeed infected,"" said Dr Daniel R Kuritzkes, chief of infectious diseases at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.,Dr Persaud and some other outside scientists said they were certain the baby — whose name and gender were not disclosed — had been infected. There were five positive tests in the baby's first month of life — four for viral RNA and one for DNA. And once the treatment started, the virus levels in the baby's blood declined in the pattern characteristic of infected patients.,Dr Persaud said there was also little doubt that the child experienced what she called a ""functional cure"". Now two-and-a-half years old, the child has been off drugs for a year with no sign of functioning virus.,The mother arrived at a rural hospital in the fall of 2010 already in labor and gave birth prematurely. She had not seen a doctor during the pregnancy and did not know she had HIV. When a test showed the mother might be infected, the hospital transferred the baby to the University of Mississippi Medical Center, where it arrived at about 30 hours old.,Dr Hannah B Gay, an associate professor of pediatrics, ordered two blood draws an hour apart to test for the presence of the virus' RNA and DNA. The tests found a level of virus at about 20,000 copies per millilitre, fairly low for a baby. But since tests so early in life were positive, it suggests the infection occurred in the womb rather than during delivery, Dr Gay said.,Typically a newborn with an infected mother would be given one or two drugs as a prophylactic measure. But Dr Gay said that based on her experience, she almost immediately used a three-drug regimen aimed at treatment, not prophylaxis, not even waiting for the test results confirming infection.,Virus levels rapidly declined with treatment and were undetectable by the time the baby was a month old. That remained the case until the baby was 18 months old, after which the mother stopped coming to the hospital and stopped giving the drugs.,When the mother and child returned five months later, Dr Gay expected to see high viral loads in the baby. But the tests were negative. Suspecting a laboratory error, she ordered more tests. ""To my greater surprise, all of these came back negative,"" Dr Gay said.,Dr Gay contacted Dr Katherine Luzuriaga, an immunologist at the University of Massachusetts, who was working with Dr Persaud and others on a project to document possible pediatric cures. The researchers, sponsored by amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research, put the baby through a battery of sophisticated tests. They found tiny amounts of some viral genetic material but no virus able to replicate, even lying dormant in so-called reservoirs in the body.,One hypothesis is that the drugs killed off the virus before it could establish a hidden reservoir in the baby. One reason people cannot be cured now is that the virus hides in a dormant state, out of reach of existing drugs. When drug therapy is stopped, the virus can emerge from hiding.,""That goes along with the concept that, if you treat before the virus has had an opportunity to establish a large reservoir and before it can destroy the immune system, there's a chance you can withdraw therapy and have no virus,"" said Dr Anthony S Fauci, the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Adults, however, typically do not know they are infected right as it happens, he said.,Dr Steven Deeks, professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, said if the reservoir never established itself, then he would not call it a true cure, though this was somewhat a matter of semantics. ""Was there enough time for a latent reservoir, the true barrier to cure, to establish itself?"" he said.,Still, he and others said, the results could lead to a new protocol for quickly testing and treating infants.,,POSITIVE SIGN: AIIMS EXPERT,DR RAKESH Lodha, a paediatric HIV expert and associate professor in the department of pediatrics at AIIMS, said the report was ""interesting"". ""One cannot call it a 'cure' as there is still evidence of viral infection even though at an extremely low level. But from the observations, the virus does not appear to be replicating and that is a positive sign,"" he said.,VIRUS LEVELS go down in many babies who get antiretroviral therapy, but the virus persists, he said. However, this does open a window of research opportunities to investigate this mechanism,and see if it can be replicated.,INDIA NUMBERS,OVER 1,00,000 children are thought to be living with HIV in India. Around 80,000 are registered at ART centres.,40,000 pregnant women test positive annually, and 12,000 children are born with the infection every year, according to NACO.

,

,

,
,


,
In a breakthrough, scientists have found that nanoparticles carrying a toxin found in bee venom can destroy HIV while leaving surrounding cells unharmed.,The finding is an important step towards developing a vaginal gel that may prevent the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS,,researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis said.,""Our hope is that in places where HIV is running rampant, people could use this gel as a preventive measure to stop the initial infection,"" said researcher Joshua L Hood.,Bee venom contains a potent toxin called melittin that can poke holes in the protective envelope that surrounds HIV, and other viruses. Large amounts of free melittin can cause a lot of damage.,The new study shows that melittin loaded onto these nanoparticles does not harm normal cells because Hood added protective bumpers to the nanoparticle surface.,When the nanoparticles come into contact with normal cells, which are much larger in size, the particles simply bounce off.,HIV, on the other hand, is even smaller than the nanoparticle, so HIV fits between the bumpers and makes contact with the surface of the nanoparticle, where the bee toxin awaits.,""Melittin on the nanoparticles fuses with the viral envelope. The melittin forms little pore-like attack complexes and ruptures the envelope, stripping it off the virus,"" Hood said.,According to Hood, an advantage of this approach is that the nanoparticle attacks an essential part of the virus' structure.,In contrast, most anti-HIV drugs inhibit the virus's ability to replicate. But this anti-replication strategy does nothing to stop initial infection, and some strains of the virus have found ways around these drugs and reproduce anyway.,""We are attacking an inherent physical property of HIV. Theoretically, there isn't any way for the virus to adapt to that. The virus has to have a protective coat, a double-layered membrane that covers the virus,"" Hood said in a statement.,Beyond prevention in the form of a vaginal gel, Hood also sees potential for using nanoparticles with melittin as therapy for existing HIV infections, especially those that are drug-resistant.,The nanoparticles could be injected intravenously and, in theory, would be able to clear HIV from the blood stream. ,While this work was done in cells in a laboratory environment, Hood and his colleagues said the nanoparticles are easy to manufacture in large enough quantities to supply them for future clinical trials.,The study was published in journal Antiviral Therapy.

In a breakthrough, scientists have found that nanoparticles carrying a toxin found in bee venom can destroy HIV while leaving surrounding cells unharmed.,The finding is an important step towards developing a vaginal gel that may prevent the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS, researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis said.,""Our hope is that in places where HIV is running rampant, people could use this gel as a preventive measure to stop the initial infection,"" said researcher Joshua L Hood.,Bee venom contains a potent toxin called melittin that can poke holes in the protective envelope that surrounds HIV, and other viruses. Large amounts of free melittin can cause a lot of damage.,The new study shows that melittin loaded onto these nanoparticles does not harm normal cells because Hood added protective bumpers to the nanoparticle surface.,When the nanoparticles come into contact with normal cells, which are much larger in size, the particles simply bounce off.,HIV, on the other hand, is even smaller than the nanoparticle, so HIV fits between the bumpers and makes contact with the surface of the nanoparticle, where the bee,toxin awaits.,""Melittin on the nanoparticles fuses with the viral envelope. The melittin forms little pore-like attack complexes and ruptures the envelope, stripping it off the virus,"" Hood said.,According to Hood, an advantage of this approach is that the nanoparticle attacks an essential part of the virus' structure.,In contrast, most anti-HIV drugs inhibit the virus's ability to replicate. But this anti-replication strategy does nothing to stop initial infection, and some strains of the,virus have found ways around these drugs and reproduce anyway.,""We are attacking an inherent physical property of HIV. Theoretically, there isn't any way for the virus to adapt to that. The virus has to have a protective coat, a,double-layered membrane that covers the virus,"" Hood said in a statement.,Beyond prevention in the form of a vaginal gel, Hood also sees potential for using nanoparticles with melittin as therapy for existing HIV infections, especially those that are drug-resistant.,The nanoparticles could be injected intravenously and, in theory, would be able to clear HIV from the blood stream.,While this work was done in cells in a laboratory environment, Hood and his colleagues said the nanoparticles are easy to manufacture in large enough quantities to supply them for future clinical trials.,The study was published in journal Antiviral Therapy.

Treating people with HIV rapidly after they have become infected with the virus that causes AIDS may be enough to achieve a ""functional cure"" in a small proportion of patients diagnosed early, according to new research.,Scientists in France who followed 14 patients who were treated very swiftly with HIV drugs but then stopped treatment found that even when they had been off therapy for more than seven years, they still showed no signs of the virus rebounding.,The research, published in the journal PLoS Pathogens, follows news earlier this month about a baby girl in Mississippi in the United States being effectively cured of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) after receiving very early treatment.,Christine Rouzioux, a professor at Necker Hospital and University Paris Descartes and a member of the initial team who identified HIV 30 years ago, said the new results showed the number of infected cells circulating in the blood of these patients, known as ""post-treatment controllers"", kept falling even without treatment for many years.,""Early treatment in these patients may have limited the establishment of viral reservoirs, the extent of viral mutations, and preserved immune responses. A combination of those may contribute to control infection in post-treatment controllers,"" she said.,""The shrinking of viral reservoirs ... closely matches the definition of 'functional' cure,"" she said.,A functional cure describes when the virus is reduced to such low levels that it is kept at bay even without continuing treatment. The virus, however, is still detectable in the body.,Most of the some 34 million people with HIV across the world will have to take anti-AIDS drugs known as antiretroviral therapy for the whole of their lives. These drugs generally keep the disease in check but also have side effects and a high cost impact on health systems.,Worldwide, the number of people newly infected with HIV, which can be transmitted via blood and by semen during sex, is falling. At 2.5 million, the number of new infections in 2011 was 20 percent lower than in 2001, according to the United National AIDS programme (UNAIDS). And deaths from AIDS fell to 1.7 million in 2011, down from a peak of 2.3 million in 2005.,Asier Saez-Cirion, a senior HIV researcher at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, said that although most patients will not be able to control HIV, these results suggest that at least some may be able to if they get treatment early enough.,""(This data) and the Mississippi study strongly support early treatment initiation and may hold important clues for the development of a strategy to cure HIV or at least induce a long-term control without the need of antiretroviral treatment,"" he said.

Casual approach of people towards AIDS in Arunchal Pradesh has resulted in a 100 fold jump in HIV positive cases in the last 14 years even though the state government has made efforts to create awareness about it.,In 1998 when the Arunachal Pradesh Aids Control Society was set up, only two HIV positive cases were reported in the entire state, but the figure rose to 202 as per the latest count made in December, 2012.,""People are still very casual in approach to the disease,"" Deputy Director of Arunachal Pradesh Aids Control Society (APSACS), Tasor Pali, said.,""Unless people are aware, no effort of waging war against AIDS will bear fruit,"" Pali, who is also in charge of Information Education Communication, said., According to a recent survey by the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), estimated cases of AIDS in the state was 1080, Pali said.,He said the actual number of AIDS positive cases would be much higher as the figures available with APSACS were only of those who voluntarily came for testing.,""Awareness is the only visible vaccine available against the killer disease,"" he said.,According to APSACS, the number of male HIV positive patients in the state was 137 and female 65.,APSACS has been engaged in targeted intervention through several NGOs working under it of high risk groups such as sex workers, intravenous drug users, truck drivers and migrant labourers.,India has the world's third largest HIV/AIDS-affected population and the Northeast the worst-affected, according to the United Nations.

,,The attention of the medical fraternity is now riveted on reports of a baby girl getting 'functionally cured' of HIV in Mississippi, the success being attributed to high doses of anti-retrovirals administered within hours of her birth. Even as it brought the focus back on an aggressive approach to preventing mother-to-child transmission of the virus, an ambitious trial is under way at Pune's B J Medical College that may well spell out a revision of the national guidelines to combat the disease.,India is ranked 10 in the annual global burden of HIV-infected pregnant women and children. Among the targets to be achieved by 2015 is bringing new HIV infections to zero, and strategies have been designed to look for the best way to prevent mother-to-child transmission. ,Researchers at B J Medical College, the only trial site in India, has enrolled 104 mother-infant pairs for the 'promoting maternal-infant survival everywhere (PROMISE)' study.  ,Dr Vidya Mave, Director of Clinical Trial Unit (CTU) at B J Medical College told The Indian Express that the study aims at finding ways to make sure the HIV-infected mother and the HIV-exposed baby stay as healthy as possible from birth and beyond weaning (when they start on solid food). ""The study will identify the optimal therapy to prevent mother-to-child transmission as well as optimal therapy for preservation of health of mothers and infants, and has  the potential of bringing about global changes to health policies,"" Mave said.,The outcome may shape the national protocol on these critical issues in the healthcare system. This project will guide strategies for implementation of prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) policies in India and the rest of the world, Mave added.,The International Maternal Paediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials Network is conducting the study with funding from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, both components of the US National Institutes of Health, US. ,'PROMISE' is a randomized strategy trial that has enrolled HIV-infected pregnant women with a CD-4 count of more than 350 from 14 weeks of gestation and prior to the onset of labour.  It has two groups, mothers who breastfeed and those who choose to formula-feed infants. A multi-centric study where mothers receive a highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) that includes zidovudine (ZDV) + nevirapine (NVP) + truvada (TRV) or lamivudine-zidovudine (3TC-ZDV)/ Lopinavir-ritnonavir (LPV-RTV) or FTC-TDF/LPV-RTV) while infants are given nevirapine (NVP) daily, through six weeks of age .,The triple-drug regimen reduces the viral load to a great extent, Dr Ramesh Bhosale, one of the principal investigators, said. While the final results will be available only after the study is completed by 2015, so far the trial has not had any adverse events. The purpose of the study is to examine effective methods of preventing transmission of HIV during pregnancy, labor, and delivery, Bhosale explained.

Looking to find out whether they were exposed to hepatitis or HIV — the virus that causes AIDS —  hundreds of patients of an oral surgeon accused of unsanitary practices showed up at a health clinic.,The patients turned up Saturday, a day after letters began going out to 7,000 patients who had seen Dr W Scott Harrington during the past six years, warning them that poor hygiene at his clinics created a public health hazard. The letter provided information on how and where to seek treatment but couldn't explain why Harrington's allegedly unsafe practices went on for so long.,Testing for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and the virus that causes AIDS began at 10 am. Saturday, but many arrived early and stood through torrential downpours. The Tulsa Health Department said 420 people were tested Saturday at its North Regional Health and Wellness Center. Screenings resume Monday morning.,Kari Childress, 38, showed up, mainly because she was nervous. ""I just hope I don't have anything,'' said Childress, who had a tooth extracted at one of Harrington's two clinics five months ago. ,Inspectors found a number of problems at the doctor's clinics in Tulsa and suburban Owasso, according to the state Dentistry Board, which filed a 17-count complaint against Harrington pending an April 19 license revocation hearing. According to the complaint, needles were reinserted into drug vials after being used on patients, expired drugs were found in a medicine cabinet and dental assistants administered sedatives to patients, rather than the doctor.,Another of Harrington's patients, Orville Marshall, said a nurse inserted the IV for his anesthesia. ""It makes you doubt the whole system,'' he said.

Over 2,300 HIV-infected people registered with various Delhi hospitals have died in the past eight years but authorities suspect the numbers could be much higher as another 3,000 who signed up with them are now untraceable and their status not known.,According to statistics compiled by Delhi State AIDS Control Society (DSACS), 2,319 HIV-infected people registered with Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centres in Delhi hospitals have died during these years while 2,936 patients have failed to turn up for treatment.,Since there is no trace of 2,936 patients, health authorities are uncertain as to how many of them are still alive.,""A total of 41,065 HIV-patients in Delhi have been registered with ART centres in the past eight years and 2,319 such patients have died due to the infection so far.,""Similarly, there are around 2,936 patients, whose treatment was initiated but they failed to continue with the treatment and are now untraceable,"" Dr A K Gupta, assistant project director of DSACS, said. ,The patients died while they were undergoing treatment for HIV infection in ART centres in the capital, he said, adding these facilities provide free of cost monthly drug dose to patients to improve their quality of life.,Whether to put patient on ART or not is decided in accordance with the severity of infection.,As per the parameters laid down by Delhi health authorities, nearly half of the total HIV positive patients are currently undergoing treatment at the ART centres.,However, more than one-third of the total patients put on treatment are not getting medical care today.,""Compared to 21,254 patients, who have been put on treatment for HIV/AIDS, number of patients getting anti- retro-viral treatment is 12,479. Besides those who have either died or failed to turn up, there are 2,700 such patients who have been shifted to other states,"" said Gupta.,He said there were another 607 patients, who have missed their last monthly visit to the ART centre and these patients are also treated as those who are not getting treatment. ,ART regimen mandates for each patient undergoing treatment to monthly visit the centre to undergo routine check up and gets monthly drugs' stock.,Besides providing drugs free of cost, rationale behind the mandatory visit is to keep patients in rapport with the centre, which assures patient's psychological care as well.,Patients, who miss three monthly visit to their respective ART centres in a row, are kept under ""Lost to Follow-Up"" category.

Researchers have developed a novel technique for cheap, quick and on-the-spot HIV testing using DVD scanners.,Researchers said the cheap optics in DVD players may find a new life in a cost-effective and speedy technique for on-the-spot HIV/AIDS testing and other analytics.,Aman Russom, senior lecturer at the School of Biotechnology at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, said that his research team converted a commercial DVD drive into a laser scanning microscope that can analyse blood and perform cellular imaging with one-micrometre resolution.,The breakthrough creates the possibility of an inexpensive and simple-to-use tool that could have far-reaching benefits in health care in the developing world.,""With an ordinary DVD player, we have created a cheap analytical tool for DNA, RNA, proteins and even entire cells,"" said Russom.,The so-called ""Lab-on-DVD"" technology makes it possible to complete an HIV test in just a few minutes, he said.,In a proof of concept demonstration, the researchers collected cell-type CD4 + from blood and visualised it using the DVD reader technology, DVD LSM.,Enumeration of these cells using flow cytometry is now standard in HIV testing, but the practise has been limited in developing countries. Russom says DVD-based technology will provide an attractive option.,The Lab-on-DVD reaps 30 years of research and development on optical storage technology to create an alternative to flow cytometry, the standard equipment for hospitals.,Flow cytometry units can cost upwards of USD 30,000, excluding maintenance. By contrast, mass-produced Lab-on-DVD units could be made available for less than USD 200, Russom said.,And unlike the bulky and technically-complex flow cytometry instruments, a Lab-on-DVD would be portable and require less training to operate.,""The low cost of the technology makes it suitable as a diagnostic and analytical tool in clinical practise close to the patient,"" Russom said.,""And because it delivers extremely fast analysis, the patient does not need to go home and wait for a response. They can get it right on the first visit to a doctor,"" said Russom.,The research was published in Nature Photonics.

Why circumcision may minimise HIV risk ,Circumcision reduces a man's risk of acquiring and transmitting HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases, and now researchers have found a possible explanation: the procedure reduces the quantity and diversity of bacteria at the head of the penis.,Researchers in Uganda studied 79 men randomly assigned to circumcision and 77 who remained uncircumcised, controlling for age, number of sexual partners and other factors. After a year, the bacterial load had decreased in both groups, possibly because being in a study spurred behaviour changes. But the decrease was significantly larger in those who were circumcised. ,Diversity of bacteria also decreased more in the circumcised men than in the uncircumcised, and almost all of the bacteria that decreased were anaerobic the kind that do not survive when exposed to oxygen at the exposed tip of the penis.,""We're not trying to prove that everyone should be circumcised,"" said the senior author, Lance B Price, a professor of occupational and environmental health at George Washington University. NYT,Mental workouts add to brain power  A review of the best evidence for interventions to prevent declining brain power finds that only one mental exercise consistently makes a difference.,The analysis of clinical trial results for assorted drugs, supplements and activities still can't say, however, whether the brain training programmes that do seem to sharpen mental function also improve people's daily lives or lower their risk of developing dementia.,""All we know is you will do better on certain (cognitive) tests. Whether that delays dementia remains to be seen,"" said Dr Raza Naqvi, the study's lead author and a researcher at the University of Toronto.,To see whether any approach fits that bill, or at least seems promising, Naqvi and his colleagues gathered results from all the randomized controlled trials they could find comparing the mental functioning of adults given a particular treatment to others who received no intervention.,Among drugs, hormone therapy, physical exercise and mental training, it was found that only the last   yielded positive results every time.

Providing universal HIV testing for India's billion-plus population every five years can save millions of lives and prove to be a cost-effective approach to managing the epidemic, scientists, including Indian researchers, claim in a new study.,It would meet international standards of cost-effectiveness  and save millions of lives for decades to test every person in the huge population of India every five years, according to the study. The findings are based on a careful analysis of India's Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic using the Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications (CEPAC) International model, a sophisticated statistical tool that has already been used in HIV policy making in France, South Africa,,and other countries.,A team of researchers at Brown, Yale, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard, and in Chennai, India, integrated scores of factors specific to the country to find that testing for the whole country, with greater frequency for high-risk groups and areas, would pay off despite India's huge population of 1.21 billion.,""Testing even 800 million adults is a public health undertaking of a historic magnitude,"" said study co-lead author Dr Kartik Venkatesh, a postdoctoral fellow at Brown University and Women & Infants Hospital.,""But what we were able to show is that even if you increase the cost of HIV treatment and care pretty significantly and really decrease the number of individuals who would link to care, even under those dire circumstances, testing this frequently and this widely still was reasonable,"" Venkatesh said. Co-author Dr Soumya Swaminathan, director of the National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis in Chennai, India, said the projections of the model will help the country in its battle with the epidemic, one of the world's largest.,""As India moves ahead in its HIV prevention activities and aims for zero new infections, expanding testing will be a key priority and this analysis should help policymakers make the best decisions,"" she said.,After extensive research to determine the best possible data for the country, researchers coded several other parameters into the model including what percentage of people would refuse the test (18 per cent), how many patients who test positive would get care (50 per cent), the prevalence of HIV in the population (0.29 per cent) etc. ,As they ran the numbers to determine the costs and effects on patients of broader and more frequent testing, they compared the results to what would happen under the status quo, in which there is less-than-universal testing.,They found that testing the population every five years would be 'cost-effective' with a price of USD 1,900 per year of life saved (YLS) in general, and USD 1,300 per YLS among  high-risk groups. The study was published in the journal PLoS One.

Scientists have for the first time built a detailed molecular model of the complex structure of the inner protein shell of HIV, paving way for potential new treatments for the deadly virus.,A team led by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine described the 4-million-atom structure of the HIV's capsid, or protein shell.,The findings, published in the journal Nature, could lead to new ways of fending off an often-changing virus that has been very hard to conquer.,Scientists have long struggled to decipher how the HIV capsid shell is chemically put together, said senior author Peijun Zhang, associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.,""The capsid is critically important for HIV replication, so knowing its structure in detail could lead us to new drugs that can treat or prevent the infection,"" she said.,""This approach has the potential to be a powerful alternative to our current HIV therapies, which work by targeting certain enzymes, but drug resistance is an enormous challenge due to the virus' high mutation rate,"" said Zhang.,Standard structural biology methods to decipher the molecular architecture were insufficient because they rely on averaged data, collected on samples of pieces of the highly variable capsid to identify how these pieces tend to go together.,Instead, the team used a hybrid approach, taking data from cryo-electron microscopy at an 8-angstrom resolution to uncover how the hexamers are connected, and cryo-electron tomography of native HIV-1 cores, isolated from virions, to join the pieces of the puzzle.,Collaborators at the University of Illinois then used their new Blue Waters supercomputer to run simulations at the petascale, involving 1 quadrillion operations per second, that positioned 1,300 proteins into a whole that reflected the capsid's known physical and structural characteristics.,The process revealed a three-helix bundle with critical molecular interactions at the seams of the capsid, areas that are necessary for the shell's assembly and stability, which represent vulnerabilities in the protective coat of the viral genome.,""The capsid is very sensitive to mutation, so if we can disrupt those interfaces, we could interfere with capsid function,"" Zhang said.,""The capsid has to remain intact to protect the HIV genome and get it into the human cell, but once inside it has to come apart to release its content so that the virus can replicate. Developing drugs that cause capsid dysfunction by preventing its assembly or disassembly might stop the virus from reproducing,"" Zhang said.

While the two had arranged the donor on their own, in both cases the concerned staff did not properly test the blood donated and transfused, reports said. ,Preliminary reports suggest that a section of the hospital staff were hand-in-glove with illegal professional donors as one of the patients claimed that he had paid Rs 1,500 in addition to the hospital fee of Rs 300 for procuring one unit of blood. ,Meanwhile, Assam CM Tarun Gogoi described the incident as of criminal nature. He asked the concerned authorities to file a criminal case. ""If they have carried out blood transfusion by taking blood from a donor without conducting proper tests, then it is surely a case of criminal negligence,"" he said. ""The government will try to provide compensation to the victims,"" he said. Meanwhile, a probe team constituted by the state health department is understood to have found serious discrepancies in the functioning of the blood bank.

An HIV positive rape convict has been set free after the Allahabad High Court reduced his sentence to the period he had already spent in jail. ,Sandeep (name changed) was lodged at Aligarh District Jail since 2006. He was detected with HIV virus in 2011 when an AIDS camp was organised in the jail campus by Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College in Aligarh. Since then, he was being treated by the doctors of the medical college. For the past one year, Sandeep was admitted at the jail hospital. ,Senior medical consultant of District Jail, Aligarh, Dr Madan Lal said Sandeep's health was deteriorating by the day and he was incapable of sitting independently and walking. It could not be ascertained when and how Sandeep contracted the disease, Lal added. ,Sandeep, now 36, was arrested in August 2006 for allegedly raping a minor girl. In 2008, a local court of Aligarh sentenced him to 10 years of imprisonment and also imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 on him. Sandeep had appealed against this judgment in the Allahabad High Court from the jail. ,Sandeep's counsel Saroj Kumar Tiwari said the court, while hearing Sandeep's appeal, sought his illness report that mentioned he was HIV positive. ""Considering his medical health, the High Court reduced his sentence to the period he had already undergone punishment in the case,"" said Tiwari.,Superintendent, Aligarh District Jail, SP Yadav said Sandeep was released from jail last Wednesday after completion of all legal formalities. He added that the fine of Rs 10,000 imposed on him was given by a society working for the welfare of the prisoners.,Sandeep, a resident of Aligarh, is married and has two children. He was a truck driver before being arrested.

With the contract for supplying CD4 kits, needed for diagnosing HIV and deciding on when to start anti-retro viral (ARV) therapy for those who test positive, ending almost two years ago and the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) yet to renew it, leading hospitals in the city ran alarmingly low on these kits last week.,NACO officials said the shortage has been addressed by making emergency purchases for 13 critically short centres across the country, including three hospitals in Delhi, over the last week. ,""The contract for the supplier expired two years ago and the process for initiating a new tender has been taking time. Emergency purchases have been made for the immediate future and we are trying to expedite the process of issuing new tenders. Till then, the centre will keep making emergency purchases to ensure there is no shortage of supply in any of the anti-retro viral therapy (ART) centres,""a NACO official said.,The Delhi State AIDS Control Society (DSACS), through NACO, replenished the test kits and reagents at Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital, Lok Nayak (LN) Hospital and  Dr B S Ambedkar Hospital last week. ,Four centres in Manipur, three in Nagaland and one each in Agra, Haryana and Mumbai have also been supplied emergency stocks.,A doctor in LN Hospital's ART centre said since March, the DSACS had been intimated several times about the shortage of stock. ,""We were getting no new supplies, so we kept sending reminders. Each time, we were told that purchases for ART centres are made by the Central government, that states were not responsible. Last week, we had no option but to refer patients to other hospitals like RML,"" he said. ,The test, which measures the count of a type of white blood cells that fight the viral infection, is crucial to decide when to start the treatment for AIDS and also monitor the efficacy of the drugs. ,According to NACO guidelines, treatment should start when CD4 cells fall below 350 cells/mm of blood.  ""Without the test, we lose a crucial tool to manage our patients who are on treatment and screen new entries. The test is also important for monitoring pregnancies in HIV positive women, to prevent mother to child transmission of the virus,"" the doctor said.,DSACS officials said they had informed NACO, as had states such as Nagaland and Manipur where ARV drugs were running out. ,Paul Lhungdim of the Delhi Network of Positive People said their representatives had also informed DSACS about the growing shortage, but was met with the same response. ,""We had given names of hospitals, before supplies completely ran out, so that they could replenish the stock in time. The situation became alarming last week as there were no kits available in three hospitals in Delhi,"" he said.

A unique pilot study by the National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) has found that regular practice of Sudarshan Kriya meditation technique and breathing exercise, has worked positively with HIV affected persons who are still not on anti-retroviral therapy. ,So far, Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) in clinical trials on patients suffering from non-communicable diseases showed a reduction of pain among cancer patients, and among addicts with  opiate and alcohol dependency. ,Depression was twice as common with people living with HIV than with the general population, which is compounded by stress and a sense of isolation from the community, Dr R S  Paranjape, director of National Institute of Virology (NIV), said and decided to embark upon this study to understand whether breathing techniques can help people living with HIV as well. ,A year-long scientific study was conducted, in which those living with HIV (who are not on medication yet) were taught breathing techniques and assessed to find whether their quality of life had improved. ,Dr Nita Mawar, principal investigator of the study, approved by the scientific research and ethical committees said, ""The pilot study involved a group of 61, with  31 persons living with HIV in the intervention arm where SKY was taught and the rest in the controlled group. The breathing exercise is the cornerstone of the Art of Living programme. ,""We wanted to experiment whether this simple technique that utilises specific rhythms of the breath can increase their energy and stamina, enhance immunity and help improve their physical and mental health,"" she said. ,An additional six-day workshop of SKY to be practiced at home for 30 minutes daily by trained Art of Living teachers followed by a practice session for a week. The SKY practice is a standardized technique and includes 3 rounds of pranayam, Bhastrika and OM Chanting followed by rhythmic breathing of Sudarshan kriya (meditation). ,A 31-item questionnaire and CD4 count were used to document effect in both groups from baseline till three visits at four weekly interval in the 12-weeks study, Mawar explained. ,The WHO–BREF HIV has 31 items and 6 domains for Physical Health, Psychological, Level of Independence, Social, Environment, Spirituality/ Religion/ Personal Beliefs. Quality of life assessed by a score developed by WHO has been tested and used in several studies, Mawar explained. People living with HIV benefited from the therapy and the results showed an improved quality of life, Mawar said. ,QOL scores improved soon after the training indicating the need for sustaining the SKY practice, Paranjape said.

,

,

,
,


,
A compound found in soybeans can be used in new treatments to inhibit the deadly HIV infection, scientists claim. Researchers from George Mason University in the US found that genistein, derived from soybeans and other plants, may become an effective HIV treatment without the drug resistance issues faced by current therapies.,Genistein is a ""tyrosine kinase inhibitor"" that works by blocking the communication from a cell's surface sensors to its interior. Found on a cell's surface, these sensors tell the cell about its environment and also communicate with other cells. HIV uses some of these surface sensors to trick the cell to send signals inside. These signals change cell structure so that the virus can get inside and spread infection.,But genistein blocks the signal and stops HIV from finding a way inside the cell. It takes a different approach than the standard antiretroviral drug used to inhibit HIV.,""Instead of directly acting on the virus, genistein interferes with the cellular processes that are necessary for the virus to infect cells,"" said Yuntao Wu, a professor with the George Mason-based National Center for Biodefense and Infectious Diseases and the Department of Molecular and Microbiology.,""Thus, it makes the virus more difficult to become resistant to the drug. Our study is currently in its early stage. If clinically proven effective, genistein may be used as a complement treatment for HIV infection,"" Wu said. Researchers caution that this doesn't mean people should start eating large amounts of soy products.,""Although genistein is rich in several plants such as soybeans, it is still uncertain whether the amount of genistein we consume from eating soy is sufficient to inhibit HIV,"" Wu said. Wu sees possibilities in this plant-based approach, which may address drug toxicity issues as well. Because genistein is plant-derived, it may be able to sidestep drug toxicity, a common byproduct of the daily and lifelong pharmaceutical regimen faced by patients with HIV to keep the disease at bay, Wu said.,Typically, patients take a combination of multiple drugs to inhibit the virus. The frequency can lead to drug toxicity. Plus, HIV mutates and becomes drug-resistant.,Wu and his team are working at finding out how much genistein is needed to inhibit HIV. It's possible that plants may not have high enough levels, so drugs would need to be developed, Wu said.

Data collected by the Chandigarh State AIDS Control Society (CSACS) revealed that there has been a decline in the number of HIV positive mothers in the city. While in 2011-2013, only 89 of 39,000 pregnant women tested positive, this year the number has come down to 7.,Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC) have been set up at various hospitals and medical centres in the city to spread awareness and encourage pregnant women to go for HIV tests. The percentage has come down from 0.24% in 2011-12 to 0.21% in 2012-13 and this year the percentage has further declined to 0.11%. CSACS data states that 17,284 women were tested in 2011-12 and of them 42 were HIV positive. In 2012-13, among 21,673 pregnant women tested, only 47 were tested positive. The number of HIV positive patients has further gone down to 7 from the 5,992 tested.,Dr Vanita Mahajan, Director, CSACS said, ""Every year about 30,000 pregnant women are tested for HIV. Though the test is not mandatory, but we urge mothers to go for the test. Our members counsel the mothers about the importance of the test."" The test is free of cost and is conducted at every hospital. ""If tested positive, mothers are sent to Anti Retroviral Therapy centre in PGIMER, where the viral load and counts are checked and she is put under medication,"" she said.,There are three stages during which HIV passes on to the baby, first during pregnancy, during delivery and then during breast-feeding. The chances of passing on the virus are equal at every stage.,Dr Vanita said, ""We don't stop HIV positive mothers from breastfeeding. Majority of mothers are poor and can not afford supplements. If they will not breastfeed the child and not give supplements, the child will die of malnutrition."" There are also chances that the child might die of diarrhoea.,Dr Vanita said, ""At CSACS, we provide free lactogen milk supplements to HIV positive mothers, who do not want to breastfeed their child.""

Adult film sets throughout the Los Angeles area have shut down indefinitely after a porn actress tested positive for HIV, the trade association for the industry said on Thursday.,The actress, who works under the name Cameron Bay, has contracted the virus that causes AIDS, the Free Speech Coalition said in a press release.,The trade group said film producers called a moratorium on production late on Wednesday and that filming would not resume until all of Bay's partners are notified and tested.,The incident comes amid continued opposition on the part of many companies that produce adult films to a recently enacted law in Los Angeles County that requires porn actors to use condoms on the set.,The multibillion-dollar adult film industry is centered in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles.,Michael Weinstein, head of the Los Angeles-based AIDS Healthcare Foundation and a backer of the condom law, said he suspects that Bay contracted the virus on a set.,Last month, he said, the actress tested negative for HIV, and this month, she tested positive. In one film that she worked on between the tests, it appears that condoms were not used, Weinstein said.,""It's a tragedy for her,"" he said. ""Obviously she was infected by someone."",The industry group said there was ""no evidence whatsoever"" that Bay was infected on a set, or that others were exposed to the virus while performing sex scenes with her.,Bay said she planned to cooperate with public health officials as they try to track down her sex partners to find out who might have infected her, and whether she infected anyone.,""As difficult as this news is for me today, I am hopeful that no other performers have been affected,"" Bay said in a statement. ,""I plan on doing everything possible to assist the medical professionals and my fellow performers."" ,

After the doctor who was to conduct her surgery learnt she was HIV positive, he tore her prescription and asked us to leave."" ,Dr J P Gupta, who allegedly refused to operate on the patient, said: ""It was not a case of surgery but of medicine. The patient had low electrolytes serum and was anemic. We have operated on many AIDS patients.""

Scientists have identified a new gene that may have the ability to prevent HIV from spreading after the virus enters the body.,The study led by King's College London is the first to identify a role for the human MX2 gene in inhibiting Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS.,Researchers said this gene could be a new target for effective, less toxic treatments where the body's own natural defence system is mobilised against the virus.,Scientists carried out experiments on human cells in the lab, introducing the virus to two different cell lines and observing the effects.,In one cell line the MX2 gene was expressed or 'switched on', and in the other it was not, or 'silenced'. They saw that in the cells where MX2 was silenced, the virus replicated and spread.,In the cells where the MX2 gene was expressed, the virus was not able to replicate and new viruses were not produced.,The work was led by Dr Caroline Goujon and Professor Mike Malim at the Department of Infectious Diseases, King's College London.,""This is an extremely exciting finding which advances our understanding of how HIV virus interacts with the immune system and opens up opportunities to develop new therapies to treat the disease,"" Malim said.,""Until now we knew very little about the MX2 gene, but now we recognise both its potent anti-viral function and a key point of vulnerability in the life cycle of HIV.,""Developing drugs to stimulate the body's natural inhibitors is a very important approach because you are triggering a natural process and therefore won't have the problem of drug resistance.,""There are two possible routes - it may be possible to develop either a molecule that mimics the role of MX2 or a drug which activates the gene's natural capabilities.,""Although people with HIV are living longer, healthier lives with the virus thanks to current effective treatments, they can often be toxic for the body and drug resistance can become an issue with long-term use.,""It is important to continue to find new ways of mobilising the body's natural defence systems and this gene appears to be a key player in establishing viral control in people with HIV,"" he said.,The study was published in journal Nature.

,

,

,
,


,
A US porn actor has tested positive for the virus that causes AIDS, the third such case reported in less than three weeks, leading a Los Angeles-based trade group for adult filmmakers to call a fresh nationwide moratorium on Friday on productions.,The infections follow a vote last year by Los Angeles County residents to require porn actors to wear condoms when having sex on set, a measure that proponents of the requirement complain is largely going unenforced in the county.,In the latest infection, a doctor affiliated with health screening facilities used by the pornography industry reported that a performer had tested positive for HIV, said Joanne Cachapero, membership director of the Free Speech Coalition, the trade group for adult filmmakers.,Details on the porn performer, including gender and any adult film company that employed him or her, were not released by the group, and Cachapero said she could not discuss in which part of the country the person was based.,""While we don't have evidence to suggest an on-set transmission as opposed to a transmission from non-industry (off-camera) related activity, we are taking every measure to determine the source and to protect the performer pool,"" the Free Speech Coalition said in a statement.,The group quickly called for another moratorium on porn productions to remain in effect indefinitely, Cachapero said.,The multibillion-dollar adult film industry, centered in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, has vigorously opposed efforts to require condom use on set.,It protested against a 2012 voter-approved measure requiring condoms to be used in Los Angeles County and has argued against efforts for such regulation at the state level that would be specifically geared to film productions.,Even before the most recent infection, the Free Speech Coalition had called a moratorium on Aug. 21 after an actress who worked under the name Cameron Bay revealed that she had contracted HIV. The moratorium ended on Aug. 27, Cachapero said.,A second porn performer, who goes by the stage name Rod Daily, said on Tuesday via Twitter that he had contracted HIV. The Free Speech Coalition said at the time that his statement appeared authentic, but did not then call a moratorium.,That is in part because Daily pursued his own medical care, rather than working through the porn industry's health screening system that triggered the moratorium in this latest case, Cachapero said.,Michael Weinstein, whose AIDS Healthcare Foundation led the successful 2012 campaign to require condoms in porn productions in Los Angeles County, expressed dismay at the new infection.,""I'm sad for the person involved,"" he said. ""But I'm really sad for our community, that we're treating these people as utterly disposable."",Weinstein said a male porn performer who he believes to be the fourth person linked to the adult film industry in recent days to test positive for HIV has contacted his organization, but he declined to release details about the man.,Los Angeles County public health officials have done little to enforce the condom requirement, he said.,""The reality of the matter is they wouldn't even defend it in the courts, we had to step up and defend the constitutionality of it, which we won,"" Weinstein said.,A spokesman for a county supervisor and a representative for the local health department could not be reached for comment late on Friday.

,

,

,
,


,
After close to eights years of counselling people on queries related to HIV/ AIDS through dedicated telephone helpline, Mukta Charitable Foundation (MCF) has now started face-to-face counselling in the city. Counsellors at MCF say the motivation for the new venture has come from help seekers themselves, who would often desire to meet and discuss problems in person.,""The trustees and our team of counsellors had long been discussing the possibility of starting face-to-face consultation. We realised though there are many types of centres, there are hardly any dedicated to HIV counselling. On August 15, we started this facility,"" says Praful Madhave,  project manager at MCF.,He admitted the Samvaad helpline's faceless nature has been one of its biggest assets in reaching people, assuring them of absolute privacy. ""Yet, many times we have received calls from people who are extremely frustrated or afraid where physical presence has been important. However, because of our policies we confined ourselevs to talking to them on phone. Follow up was also not possible from our end as we take no personal details on the helpline,"" says Madhave.,For now, the counselling sessions are strictly for those who take prior appointment. ""If the caller is from Pune and our telephone counsellors feel that personally meeting would help, they tell them about face-to-face counselling and share a number that is with our personal counsellor to fix an appointment. We have already had three cases since we started this venture,"" says Madhave.,Seeking to remain anonymous, a MCF counsellor  who has been a Samvaad counsellor for five years and is now conducting face-to-face counselling, said  it will be very helpful if cases are followed up and reach completion. ""Telephonic counselling has several advantages but while sitting with a person I can see his or her body language, expressions and hesitation. It helps me proceed accordingly. I am also able to show short film clips and testimonies of other HIV+ patients to motivate them. We are able to give them detailed consultation on diet as well give handouts, which was previously not possible,"" she says.,Sharing the cases that have come to her, the counsellor says they are representative of society at large. ""There were cases where  a man had just realised his HIV+ status and was grappling with various fears, another was a young boy who was scared of being at risk. The third case was of an extra-marital affair. We have been able to engage with them at length. When we meet them we are able to pick where we left and help bring behavioural changes,"" she says.,Madhave clarified that even though MCF seeks to move forward with the face-to-facecounselling, the regular helpline will not be phased out. ""Its reach is much wider and that will remain our core,"" he says.

India is a close second to South Africa in healthy, productive years people lose to HIV/AIDS, a 2010 study published in journal AIDS  shows. There were 2.4 million people estimated to have HIV in 2010 with a Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) of 9,265.13 (in thousands). DALYs represent productive years lost due to premature death or disability to HIV/AIDS.,In 2010, India accounted for 11.4 per cent of DALY's global HIV/ AIDS. The 5 countries with the largest percentage of total global deaths from HIV/AIDS are South Africa (14.6%), India (11.4%), Nigeria (11.1%), Tanzania (5.7%), Mozambique (4.7%.),HIV/AIDS is a formidable problem in India but no longer on the rise, showing a peak in mortality in 2007. Since 2007, HIV/AIDS deaths dropped by 8.7%.,Although HIV/AIDS is the 5th cause of disease burden in the world, it did not breach the top 10 causes of disease burden in India in 2010, said Prof Lalit Dandona, Research Professor at Public Health Foundation of India and Professor of Global Health at the University of Washington.,Diarrhoea and ischemic heart disease accounted for 5.2% and 5.1% respectively of India's DALYs in 2010. ,""While India has made advances in control of many infectious diseases and malnutrition over two decades, these remain significant contributors to the disease burden. On the other hand, the contribution of heart disease, major depression, obstructive lung disease, as well as road accidents, to the disease burden has increased over this period"", Dandona said. ,The overall annual death rate from AIDS has fallen by 21% since 2006, a recent study in Global Burden of Disease (GBD) series shows. The report says in 22% of the 182 countries with documented cases of AIDS, AIDS-related mortality and HIV-related disability are rising.In most cases, this is because countries still have low prevalence or in some cases, HIV arrived late.,In 2011, eight million HIV positive people received ARTs (a 20-fold increase since 2003), translating into 54% of all eligible in low and middle-income countries. Expansion of ART coverage is likely to have contributed to reversal of the global trend in HIV/AIDS mortality.,ANURADHA MASCARENHAS

The Bombay High Court has ordered the state government to reinstate the driver who was sacked by the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) after he had voluntarily told the authorities that he is HIV positive.,A Bench comprising Justices Revati Mohite-Dere and Abhay Oka ordered that the MSRTC's decision to fire the driver be cancelled. The HC directed the state government to reinstate him within a week. It is also expected that the High Court will award compensation to the driver, who hails from a village in Pune district and had been working with the MSRTC since 1999. MSRTC had dismissed him from the service in 2012 stating that he was unfit to work. ,In 2008, during a routine health check-up it was found that he was HIV positive. He started the treatment and but was finding it difficult to go on long routes. ,He asked the MSRCTC authorities for less strenuous work schedule. On MSRTC's advice, he did four tests between 2009 and 2012 at a government hospital. It was found that he was fit to work but should not be given strenuous jobs. In the third report given in February 2012, the hospital stated that he should be given light duty work  as he is suffering from peripheral neuropathy. It had resulted in difficulty in sensing pain, temperature, touch particularly in legs. He asked for the duty of peon, but MSRTC did not act. ,MSRTC once again sought opinion from the hospital whether he can drive heavy vehicles, to which the hospital replied in negative. The MSRTC officially terminated his services in May 2012 stating he was unfit for work. The driver's wife had to work as a labourer and even children were forced to work due to this. ,After a TV channel showed a news about the driver, city-based lawyer Asim Sarode of NGO Sahyog Trust  got in touch with the driver. ,Sarode said, ""We filed a writ petition last year and the HC passed an order to reinstate him in a week. Now arguments will be held over quantum of compensation to be paid by  MSRTC for violating his rights.There is no law for HIV persons. The MSRTC discriminated  against the driver and violated his human rights.""

,

,

,
,


,
A promising new AIDS vaccine may be able to completely eradicate the deadly HIV from the body, a new study has claimed.,The HIV/AIDS vaccine candidate developed at Oregon Health & Science University has demonstrated the capacity to effectively remove all traces of an AIDS-causing virus from non-human primates, researchers said.,The promising vaccine is being tested through the use of a non-human primate form of HIV, called simian immunodeficiency virus, or SIV, which causes AIDS in monkeys.,Following further development, it is hoped an HIV-form of the vaccine candidate can soon be tested in humans.,""To date, HIV infection has only been cured in a very small number of highly publicised but unusual clinical cases in which HIV-infected individuals were treated with anti-viral medicines very early after the onset of infection or received a stem cell transplant to combat cancer,"" said Louis Picker, associate director of the OHSU Vaccine and Gene Therapy Institute.,""This latest research suggests that certain immune responses elicited by a new  vaccine may also have the ability to completely remove HIV from the body,"" said Picker.,The Picker lab's approach involves the use of cytomegalovirus, or CMV, a common virus already carried by a large percentage of the population.,Researchers discovered that pairing CMV with SIV had a unique effect. They found that a modified version of CMV engineered to express SIV proteins generates and indefinitely maintains so-called ""effector memory"" T-cells that are capable of searching out and destroying SIV-infected cells.,T-cells are a key component of the body's immune system, which fights off disease, but T-cells elicited by conventional vaccines of SIV itself are not able to eliminate the virus.,The SIV-specific T-cells elicited by the modified CMV were different. About 50 per cent of monkeys given highly pathogenic SIV after being vaccinated with this vaccine became infected with SIV but over time eliminated all trace of SIV from the body.,In effect, the hunters of the body were provided with a much better targeting system and better weapons to help them find and destroy an elusive enemy.,""Through this method we were able to teach the monkey's body to better 'prepare its defences' to combat the disease,"" said Picker.,""Our vaccine mobilised a T-cell response that was able to overtake the SIV invaders in 50 per cent of the cases treated. Moreover, in those cases with a positive response, our testing suggests SIV was banished from the host. We are hopeful that pairing our modified CMV vector with HIV will lead to a similar result in humans,"" said Picker.,The study was published in the journal Nature.

,
,


,
People Living with HIV (PLHIV) still fight shy of declaring their status, scientists with National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) said pointing out that studies indicate they preferred home-based care as it was free of stigma and ensured confidentiality.,Dr R S Paranjape, Director of NARI, said even if people are on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) they preferred to hide their HIV status. Dr Seema Sahay, scientist at NARI who has been part of a recent Pune-based study that assessed caregivers of PLHIV, found that the fear of stigma surfaced when the women members of the family visualized neighbours coming to know about the HIV status.,The qualitative study conducted between 2008 and 2010 had a total of 44 in-depth interviews with 20 PLHIVs and 24 caregivers. Published in Plos One journal, the findings show that half of the PLHIVs (10/20) and their caregivers (13/24) preferred home-based care owing to affordability, free of stigma and convenience, Sahay said.,Some of the caregivers reinforced that there was no fear of stigmatisation and disclosure in case the PLHIV received home-based care. Even as the annual number of new HIV infections has been steadily declining, people are not disclosing their status. According to Dr R R Bamble, Pune Municipal Corporation's HIV/AIDS nodal officer, there were 1,891 new HIV cases detected in Pune from January to July.,""There has been a significant drop in new infections due to awareness measures taken over the period of years,"" he said. However Kalyani Patil, Pune district officer of Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS), said people were not willing to come out in the open and disclose their HIV status.,Over the years, the government welfare programmes have helped bring down the prevalence rate of HIV infection. In Pune district it is a mere 5.48 per cent of the population while the numbers of HIV positive people have gone down among the high risk population like sex workers.,According to Bamble, out of the 3,587 brothel-based sex workers , 149 tested for HIV infection in 2012 while out of 2,523 non-brothel-based workers, 53 tested positive.  Vinod Jamble, programme director of Network of PLHIV in Maharashtra, said despite improvement in their health conditions, there was a need to also provide a better quality of life for them.,A total of 34 care support centres are being set up in Maharashtra and Goa under the programme 'Vihaan' to ensure that they can work without fear of stigma and discrimination.,Bindumadhav Khire, President of Sampathik Trust that reaches out to 1,600 Men having sex with Men (MSM) high-risk group, said 23 were tested HIV positive. However, they are so scared to reveal their HIV status that they cannot even get hospitalised, he rued.

,

,
,


,
For the first time, HIV positive pregnant women will be given a three-drug regimen to cut the risk of transmission of the virus to their newborns. The ambitious programme will soon be rolled out across the state.,A three-day programme was launched at Pimpri on Thursday where training on the drug regimen was imparted to district health officials, medical officers from government colleges and Anti-Retroviral Treatment (ART) centres.,Dr Asha Hegde, in-charge of the Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission (PPTCT) programme of Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) who is conducting the training, said the prevalence of HIV infection in pregnant women has come down from 3 per cent to 0.4 per cent.,As per the World Health Organisation's (WHO) new guidelines on treatment for PMTCT (preventing mother-to-child transmission) and on HIV and breastfeeding, instead of a single drug, the HIV positive pregnant woman will be given a three-drug regimen that consists of drugs lamivudine, efavirenz and tenofovir, said Dr R A Bhosale, Head of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, B J Medical College. Hegde, who is supervising the training, said the triple-drug regimen should be taken throughout pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding, continuing for life, regardless of CD4 count or clinical stage.,Presently there are an estimated 4.5 lakh people living with HIV in the state, of which 1.3 lakh people are on anti-retroviral treatment provided free of cost at 72 ART centres. There are an estimated 20,000 children living with HIV in the state, of which 6,000 are on ART. Since 2010 till now a total of 1,000 babies were detected with HIV under the Early Infant Diagnosis (EID) programme, Hegde said.,Till now, an HIV positive pregnant woman was given a single drug therapy (Nevirapine) to prevent the infection to the ,foetus. Despite administering this drug to the mother during labour and the child after birth, the newborn has an 8-10 per cent chance of infection. With the new drug regime, the chances of infection could go down to 1-2 per cent, programme experts said.,In Pune, every year approximately 10,000 pregnant women are enrolled at Sassoon General Hospital. Bhosale said since the government hospital gets referrals from other places, the HIV positivity rate in pregnant women varies from 2-2.5 per cent. While NVP has been effective, research has shown that there is resistance to this drug and hence the triple drug therapy has been recommended, he said.,,ANURADHA MASCARENHAS

Despite the heavy workload, Valiv ,who took charge as Deputy Regional Transport Officer three months ago, continues to play cupid by helping HIV positive people tie the knot. ,This officer was so moved by a friend's death due to AIDS that in 2006 he decided to start a free-of-cost matrimonial website for HIV positive people. Since then he has prepared a database of more than 5,000 such persons. ,""Ten years ago it was extremely difficult for a HIV positive person to speak openly about his/her problem.

,

,

,
,


,
A new easy-to-use intra-vaginal ring filled with an anti-retroviral drug could be extremely effective at preventing the deadly HIV in women, a new study has found.,The ring is easy to use, long lasting, and recently has demonstrated a 100 per cent success rate protecting primates from the simian immunodeficiency virus (SHIV).,The device will soon undergo its first test in humans, researchers said.,""After 10 years of work, we have created an intra-vaginal ring that can prevent against multiple HIV exposures over an extended period of time, with consistent prevention levels throughout the menstrual cycle,"" said Patrick Kiser, an expert in intra-vaginal drug delivery.,Previous studies have demonstrated that antiviral drugs can prevent HIV infection, but existing methods for delivering the drug fall short.,Pills must be taken daily and require high doses; vaginal gels that must be applied prior to each sex act are inconvenient, yielding poor usage rates.,The new ring is easily inserted and stays in place for 30 days. And because it is delivered at the site of transmission, the ring - known as a TDF-IVR (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate intravaginal ring) - utilises a smaller dose than pills.,The device contains powdered tenofovir, an anti-retroviral drug that is taken orally by 3.5 million HIV-infected people worldwide, but that has not previously been studied topically, researchers said.,The ring's strength stems from its unique polymer construction: its elastomer swells in the presence of fluid, delivering up to 1,000 times more of the drug than current intra-vaginal ring technology, such as NuvaRing, which are made of silicon and have release rates that decline over time.,The upcoming clinical trial, to be conducted in November at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, will evaluate the ring in 60 women over 14 days.,The trial will assess the ring's safety and measure how much of the drug is released and the properties of the ring after use.,Other drugs could potentially be integrated into the ring, such as contraceptives or antiviral drugs to prevent other sexually transmitted infections - a feature that could increase user rates, said Kiser, who joined Northwestern University from the University of Utah, where the research was conducted.,

,

,

,
,


,
In a breakthrough, scientists have mapped the most detailed images yet of the protein responsible for getting HIV into cells, paving way for a potential vaccine for AIDS.,The new findings of the AIDS-causing virus's complex envelope, includes sites that future vaccines will try to mimic to elicit a protective immune response.,Scientists at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) and Weill Cornell Medical College determined the first atomic-level structure of the tripartite HIV envelope protein long considered one of the most difficult targets in structural biology and of great value for medical science.,""Most of the prior structural studies of this envelope complex focused on individual subunits; but we've needed the structure of the full complex to properly define the sites of vulnerability that could be targeted, for example with a vaccine,"" said Ian A Wilson, a senior author of the study.,HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus, currently infects about 34 million people globally, 10 per cent of whom are children, according to World Health Organisation estimates.,Although antiviral drugs are now used to manage many HIV infections, especially in developed countries, scientists have long sought a vaccine that can prevent new infections and perhaps ultimately eradicate the virus from the human population.,However, none of the HIV vaccines tested so far has come close to providing adequate protection. This failure is due largely to the challenges posed by HIV's envelope protein, known to virologists as Env.,Env's structure is so complex and delicate that scientists have had great difficulty obtaining the protein in a form that is suitable for the atomic-resolution imaging necessary to understand it.,""It tends to fall apart, for example, even when its on the surface of the virus, so to study it we have to engineer it to be more stable,"" said biologist Andrew Ward.,The research team was able to engineer a version of the Env trimer (three-component structure) that has the stability and other properties needed for atomic-resolution imaging, yet retains virtually all the structures found on native Env.,Using cutting-edge imaging methods, electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, the team was able to look at the new Env trimer.,The X-ray crystallography study was the first ever of an Env trimer, and both methods resolved the trimer structure to a finer level of detail than has been reported before.,The data illuminated the complex process by which the Env trimer assembles and later undergoes radical shape changes during infection and clarified how it compares to envelope proteins on other dangerous viruses, such as flu and Ebola.,The findings are published in the journal Science Express.

Acknowledging the need for the scaling up of interventions against HIV in India, the Secretary of the Department of AIDS Control, Lov Verma, Saturday called for community participation to ensure complete eradication of the disease. ""Involvement of the community is key for a successful intervention programme and the public health system could not move without their involvement,"" Verma said.,He was speaking at the conclusion of a two-day National Dissemination Workshop in Delhi. ,Stressing on the need for scaling up HIV interventions, including Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST) for injecting drug users, Verma said that the Department of AIDS Control was in touch with a number of corporate agencies to garner their support in implementing HIV programmes in the country.,Under the corporate social responsibility law, companies are to allocate a minimum of 2 per cent of their total profits towards projects that positively impact society.,He further said that HIV prevalence was as high as 5 per cent among injecting drug users in states like Bihar, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab.,""Meaningful involvement of the community in programme planning and implementation, treatment of Hepatitis-C, drug overdose management and the need for developing a comprehensive service package is important,"" he said. Reiterating the importance of community strengthening and involvement, Swarup Sarkar, Special Adviser to UNITAID, said that communities, be it drug users, transgenders or sex workers, knew the best and the solutions lay with them.

,

,

,
,


,
Scientists have for the first time identified a protein in breast milk that neutralises HIV and may protect babies from acquiring the virus from their infected mothers.,The protein, called Tenascin-C or TNC, had previously been recognised as playing a role in wound healing, but had not been known to have antimicrobial properties. The discovery could lead to potential new HIV-prevention strategies.,Researchers at Duke University Medical Center found the TNC protein in breast milk binds to and neutralises the HIV virus, protecting exposed infants who might otherwise become infected from repeated exposures to the virus.,""Even though we have antiretroviral drugs that can work to prevent mother-to-child transmission, not every pregnant woman is being tested for HIV, and less than 60 per cent are receiving the prevention drugs, particularly in countries with few resources,"" said senior study author Sallie Permar, assistant professor of pediatrics, immunology and molecular genetics and microbiology at Duke.,""So there is still a need for alternative strategies to prevent mother-to-child transmission, which is why this work is important,"" Permar said.,In their study, the Duke team screened mature milk samples from uninfected women for neutralising activity against a panel of HIV strains, confirming that all of the detectable HIV-neutralisation activity was contained in the high molecular weight portion.,Using a multi-step protein separation process, the researchers narrowed the detectable HIV-neutralisation activity to a single protein, and identified it as TNC.,""TNC is a component of the extracellular matrix that is integral to how tissues hold themselves together,"" Permar said, noting that co-author Harold Erickson, professor of cell biology at Duke, was among the first to identify and describe TNC in the 1980s.,Researchers found the protein is uniquely effective in capturing virus particles and neutralises the virus, specifically binding to the HIV envelope.,""It's likely that TNC is acting in concert with other anti-HIV factors in breast milk, and further research should explore this,"" Permar said.,""But given TNC's broad-spectrum HIV-1-binding and neutralising activity, it could be developed as an HIV-prevention therapy, given orally to infants prior to breastfeeding, similar to the way oral rehydration salts are routinely administered to infants in developing regions,"" Permar said.,Permar said TNC would also be inherently safe, since it is a naturally occurring component of breast milk, and it may avoid the problem of HIV resistance to antiretroviral regimens that complicate maternal/infant applications.,The study was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Concerns and issues pertaining to adolescents living with HIV were deliberated upon at the two-day state-level meet, Positive Growing: The Way Ahead, organised by the Forum on Child Protection and HIV, at Yashada on Wednesday. The meet finalised a draft of recommendations to ensure enhanced integration of these children.,Dr Vinay Kulkarni of NGO Prayas said, ""We are now coming across the first generation of HIV adolescents and we have not yet given a serious thought to their needs. We need to update programme to address their dilemmas and aspirations."",The major recommendation in the draft is to gauge the number of adolescents living with HIV. Five per cent of the 2.1 million people living with HIV in the country are children but adolescents have been ignored. The Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) does not have data on the number of adolescents living with the disease, said Kulkarni.,He said children, who have recovered from the disease after undergoing anti-retroviral therapy, face problems like freely talking to their friends  about their status or problems that are likely to emerge when they get intimate with a partner.  ""We have called for a round table meeting with Women and Child Development minister,"" he added.,Pramod Nirgudkar, Director, Committed Community Development Trust (CCDT), said, ""Young people should be be involved in devising strategies and processes for their holistic development. They are a resource and not a problem."",Ranjeet (name changed) of the So What? group, an organisation of ALHIV, said, ""I have spent half my childhood in hospitals. Improving my health was the only concern at that age. Now, I want to go beyond this concern and complete my education. This is my priority."",Dr Raman Gangakhedkar, Deputy Director, National AIDS Research Institute, said ""We should adopt different strategies to control HIV among young and adolescents and address gaps in programmes."",Representatives of NGOs Snehalaya, Sangram and Chirag also shared their experiences.,Issues related to disclosure, education, vocational training, institutional and home-based care were also discussed at the meet. Manoj Pardeshi of NMP said, ""More than institutional care, we need to promote the concept of family and non institutional care.""

,

,
Almost 12 years after the government first announced its plan to bring in a law to check discrimination against people suffering from HIV/AIDS, the proposed law, which is still in the works, has hit yet another roadblock.,For a law that seeks to establish a humane, legal regime to support prevention, treatment and care to HIV/AIDS patients as well as preventing discrimination against anyone suffering from the same, the Union Health Ministry is opposed to ,any punishment clause in the proposed HIV and AIDS (Prevention and Control) Bill, 2013 to punish any employer or individual who ,discriminates against anybody suffering from the disease.,However, the Union Law Ministry is refusing to buy the Health Ministry's logic that any punishment clause for offences under Section 3 in Chapter II, which deals with prohibition of certain act (against those infected with HIV/AIDS), would turn the proposed law ""draconian"".,Sources told The Indian Express that during discussions on the subject, senior officials of the Union Ministry of Law and Justice made it clear to functionaries of the Union Health Ministry that without any penal clause that prescribes punishment for offences under the law, the purpose of enacting the law would be ""completely defeated"". ,However, the Health Ministry officials have, so far, refused to budge, insisting that a punishment clause is not acceptable.,Having failed to convince the Health Ministry, the Law Ministry has now put its objections on paper and asked the Health Ministry to let the Cabinet take a decision on the matter when it takes up the Bill for clearance.,""We have held many meetings with the Health Ministry officials. But they are adamant. Our viewpoint is that unless punishment is prescribed for an offence under the proposed law, the entire purpose of the law would be defeated.,""For example, it says that no person shall discriminate against a protected person (anybody suffering from HIV or AIDS) on any ground, including denial or termination from employment. But there is no punishment prescribed for anybody who commits this offence. How can this work? But, Health Ministry is refusing to accept this,"" said a Law Ministry official on condition of anonymity.,Under the proposed law, among other things, HIV/AIDS-infected persons will be provided protection against discrimination in employment, healthcare, education, travel and insurance, in both the public and private sectors.,The first draft of the proposed law was finalised in 2006 after many rounds of consultations with state governments, State AIDS Control Societies (SACS) and NGOs. But, the Bill is still to be tabled in Parliament.

,

,

,
,


,
Scientists have discovered a molecular invisibility cloak that enables HIV, the virus that causes the deadly AIDS, to hide inside cells of the body without triggering the body's natural defence systems.,The study shows how 'uncloaking' the virus using an experimental drug triggers an immune response that stops the virus from replicating in cells grown in the laboratory.,The findings could lead to new treatments and help to improve existing therapies for HIV infection, researchers said.,The innate immune system is the body's first line of defence against infection and incorporates an alarm system present in all cells of the body that detects the presence of 'foreign' material from invading bacteria and viruses.,When the alarm is tripped, the infected cell begins an anti-viral programme and sends out warning signals to alert other cells that a virus is around.,HIV infects vital cells of the immune system so its ability to replicate undetected without triggering this alarm system has puzzled scientists since the discovery of the virus.,The team identified two molecules inside host cells that are recruited by HIV after infection that stop the virus from reproducing its genetic material too early. The effect is to shield the virus from the alarm system and stop the innate immune system from kicking into action.,In the absence of these molecules, either by depletion from infected cells or blocking their recruitment using an experimental drug, HIV is exposed to the alarm system and an anti-virus immune response is triggered.,Targeting the cloaking molecules and not the virus itself makes it much more difficult for the virus to mutate and become resistant to this treatment approach, a significant problem with standard HIV therapies.,""HIV is extremely adept at hiding from our body's natural defences, which is part of the reason the virus is so dangerous. Now we've identified the virus' invisibility cloak, and how to expose it, we've uncovered a weakness that could be exploited for new HIV treatments,"" professor Greg Towers, a Wellcome Trust Senior Research Fellow at University College London (UCL) and lead author of the study, said.,""There's a great deal more research needed but the potential for this approach is huge, as a possible treatment in itself but also as a complement to existing therapies.,""We're also interested to see whether blocking these cloaking molecules can help to boost immune responses to experimental vaccines against HIV or be used to protect against HIV transmission,"" said Towers.

,


,
The decline in the number of new HIV infection cases in the last three to four years has prompted the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) to set up an anti-retroviral treatment (ART) centre at PMC-run Rajiv Gandhi Hospital in Yerawada. Due to the success of anti-retroviral therapy, efforts are now under way to sustain free medication for HIV patients and help bring down the transmission rate.,For the first time, space at the hospital will be utilised by NACO to set up the city's fifth ART centre. At present, the Sassoon General Hospital's ART centre has the highest number of patients. Armed Forces Medical College, National AIDS Research Institute and YCM Hospital at Pimpri too have ART centres.,Dr Rajeev Bamble, nodal officer, Pune State AIDS Control Society (PSACS), said a total of 1,329 men and 969 women tested positive for HIV from January to October, 2013. Last year, the PSACS detected 2,808 new HIV infections. In 2011, there were 3,745 new HIV infection cases, down from 4,440 registered at integrated counselling and testing centres across the city in 2010.,""There has been a significant drop in the number of new cases,"" said Bamble, adding that while the HIV detection rate was more than 10 per cent in 2005 at ICTCs, it had now dropped to nearly 3 per cent. The dip in fresh HIV cases is being attributed to an increasing awareness among people, including the risk groups of sex workers and men having sex with men, and free dispensation of medication. ,""Once the viral load comes down, the HIV transmission is arrested,"" says Dr D B Kadam, in charge of the ART centre at Sassoon that has over 11,000 HIV patients. ,According to the PSACS data, the rate of transmission from mother to child has declined too. Out of the 36,295 (ante-natal care) pregnant women who took the test this year, as many as 128 were detected with HIV. ,Meanwhile, Bamble said, private hospitals were being encouraged to set up HIV testing facilities. As part of a private public partnership, applications from Sutika Seva Mandir, Sahara Aalhad, Rao Nursing Home, Dwarka Medical Foundation and others have joined the initiative. ""However, we need a better response from private hospitals to set up HIV testing facilities. This is also in keeping with this year's World AIDS Day (December 1) theme of shared responsibility and strengthening results for an AIDS-free generation,"" said Bamble.

Iran wants a high-level business delegation from India to test for HIV before issuing visas, angering New Delhi as such a demand is seen as discriminatory and politically incorrect. ,Most countries have done away with this requirement and India too ended mandatory HIV testing for visa applicants more than a decade ago.,The 97-member delegation has been put together by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), and has 68 executive director-rank officials from firms such as Oswal, Metro Tyres, Luminous Power, Kohinoor Foods, and RP Goenka.,The group is scheduled to visit Tehran from December 15 to 17 to showcase Indian products and for a buyer-seller meet in Isfahan on December 19 on the invitation of the Tehran Chamber of Commerce and Iran Chamber of Commerce.,Members of the delegation have also been asked to test for Hepatitis C and Tuberculosis, all for the first time, sources said, forcing New Delhi to raise the issue through diplomatic channels with Iranian authorities.,The Indian government, through a November 22, 2002 order, had announced a change in policy, ending all mandatory HIV testing for foreign-born residents and visa applicants, including foreign students.,While no specific reason has been given for this move by Iran, India sees this as barriers being created and considers it a worrying sign. New Delhi feels that hurdles such as these are indicative of why business ties don't seem to take off despite the best of intentions.,The main objective of the delegation is to increase India's exports to Iran, which registered a fall of 3.77 per cent during 2011-12, mainly due to problems with banking channels. Although latest figures are not available, they are expected to have dipped further.

The Delhi High Court on Friday allowed an HIV positive 19-year-old girl, rescued from a brothel, to terminate her pregnancy, even though it was beyond the permissible period prescribed by the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act. ,The girl, who is over 19 weeks pregnant, had approached the court earlier this week after the authorities at the women's shelter home refused to accede to her request, citing the MTP Act, which prohibits abortion of a foetus aged between 12-20 weeks. ,In the plea, filed through legal aid counsel Nandita Rao, the girl had asked the staff at the Nari Niketan for an abortion, as the pregnancy was the result of ""repeated rape at the brothel"". ,Justice Sunita Gupta allowed the girl's petition, accepting her submissions that she was from the poor strata of society and it was a forced pregnancy amounting to rape as she was in the brothel.  The court directed the authorities at Nari Niketan to get the girl admitted to a government hospital within three days. It ordered that a medical board be constituted to terminate her pregnancy. The court directed the government to provide proper diet and shelter to the girl. ,Under the MTP Act, a foetus may be terminated up to 20 weeks of pregnancy if a medical board of two doctors opines that the pregnancy posed a risk to the physical and mental health of the mother.

,

,

,
,


,
,,,,,India has shown decline in new infections by more than 50 per cent in the last 10 years. The prominent reason is a largely successful targetted intervention programme by the Centre and a sustained information, education and communication campaign. The focus on promoting use of condom and providing interventions in high-risk groups like commercial sex workers and men having sex with men is also a reason that has led to the decline. The prevalence of HIV infection has been declining every year thanks to these efforts. A majority of the people are on anti-retroviral therapy (ART); they will continue to remain infected but will arrest the transmission of the virus.,,Ten years ago, 2.7 million people were estimated to have been infected with HIV. Over the years, the decline in new infections has been effected due to efforts made by the National AIDS Control Organisation. There is no vaccine or microbicide but sustained use of condoms and behavioural changes were among the key factors that led to the decline. NGOs also played a huge role.,,You will be surprised to know that in the 12th Five Year Plan, the Department of AIDS Control has provided tremendous funding for the programme. A majority of the HIV prevention programmes were funded by international agencies, but the government has now allocated a huge amount.,,India is a big country. With so many ART centres and different channels to procure funds, it is likely that there will be procedural issues. We may have an occasional stock-out but reaching out to 6.5 lakh to provide free ART is a huge task. Of course, stock-outs should not happen and a week ago we did fear one at our ART centre at Model Colony. But it just took a couple of calls and NACO immediately sent the supply.,,First of all, the trial was not called off. The recent HIV vaccine trial tested ADVAX — a DNA-based vaccine as the prime and a vector, Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA), as the boost. They were found to be safe but in spite of several efforts we were not able to ensure stability of the vaccine or in other words found that the vector was genetically unstable.,,HIV is a complicated virus. There is no clear-cut co-relate of protection. For instance, in any other medical condition, like say tetanus, once the vaccine is injected, it stimulates the body to make antibodies against the tetanus toxin and these protect one from illness. Again, there are ethical issues related to animal testing. The testing for HIV vaccine can be done only in monkeys and there are issues like availability that have to be dealt with. Also, the virus mutates or changes very fast. The vaccine has to be developed against a wide variety of HIV strains. However, there is progress made on identifying a portion of the HIV common to various strains. Neutralising antibodies have shown potential in the treatment of retroviral infections. This can neutralise the HIV strain. The second step is also to develop immunogens.,,Hopefully, we will see a new generation of vaccines to be tested in the next two to three years. However, this is a complex virus and it will take long time from the time it is taken for testing vaccine candidates to obtaining licences and so on. We are hopeful, though.,,Luckily, there are no new high-risk groups. Of concern is the migrant population that is always on the move. The prevalence of HIV is also not as high in truck drivers as it was earlier. Among the areas that have high HIV prevalence include Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Manipur. Tamil Nadu is no longer among the high prevalence states. Injecting drug use has been the driver of the epidemic in Manipur while in the other states is it commercial sex that has driven the HIV epidemic. There are, however, increasing reports of injecting drug use in Punjab and parts of Maharashtra.,,One of our major partners in the USA is National Institutes of Health and among other collaborations include Yale University, Duke University and Vanderbilt University. A neuro-AIDS programme with a California-based university was a huge success. Presently, we have tied up with Melbourne University and also plans are under way on an Indo-French project. With South Africa too, there is a programme to assess different responses to control HIV. We have not directly collaborated with Third World countries, but helped Bhutan set up a laboratory for HIV drug resistance, sent teams for training people in Sri Lanka and also helped in a project for proficiency drug resistance for CD 4 testing estimation in Thailand.,,I am proud to say that our study on HIV discordant couples (where one person is HIV positive while the partner is not infected) had a role to play in WHO recommending new guidelines for treatment in June this year. In our study, we initiated treatment when the person had a CD 4 count between 350 and 500 as against 250 and followed the participants for a specific period. We found that at least 96 per cent of the partners were protected who had received ART. If treatment is started early, there is an advantage in protecting people from transmitting the virus and arresting the progression of the disease. WHO has recommended that any HIV positive person with a CD 4 count of 500 or less should be immediately put on treatment. We are optimistic that the government will implement these recommendations.,,There is not much data from rural areas. However, there is not much difference in the HIV-prevalence rates. As you know, there is more than 60 per cent urbanisation in Maharashtra and in general there is a lot of mobility between urban and rural areas.,,I will not be able to comment on helplines as there has been no study to assess their impact. Stigma does persist but it has gone down. NARI has started a rural unit at Karad and the feedback we get is surprising. For instance, there is a provision of concessional travel for HIV positive persons and we were pleasantly surprised that they readily availed of the government facility.,,A single dose of Nevirapine has led to a 50 per cent decline. This single drug regimen has now been replaced with a multi-drug one. The bigger challenge, however, is to reach out to pregnant women and bring them under the mother-to-child prevention of HIV transmission programme.,,One major change was the phasing out of the drug, Stavudine, and introducing Tenofovir. Drug resistance has not gone up and these regimens are effective in treating HIV. We will have to focus on IEC campaigns and inter-sectoral coordination to include more pregnant women in the programme.,,By and large, yes. The government has set up several ART centres to ensure that issues like access to treatment is taken care of.,,There are unconfirmed reports, so it is difficult to comment. However, drugs that are used have been tested on humans and then marketed. Not many trials are undertaken with alternative medicine and there is need for more research.,,As per the protocol, the volunteers are looked after during the trial. Anyone who has participated in the trial is encouraged to come to NARI for follow-ups.,,Fortunately, there have been no major serious adverse events. Reports are sent to the Drug Controller General of India. We take care of the participants during the trial period. All projects are cleared by ethical committees and travel reimbursement is provided. After the SC ruling, we have been working out ways to develop a mechanism to pay compensation.,,

Here has been an overall dip in the number of fresh HIV cases in Pune district. The rate of HIV transmission has declined from 9.7 per cent in 2007-08 to 4.5 per cent in 2012-13, district health authorities said on Monday.,Of the 1.02 lakh persons tested for HIV between March 2012 and April 2013, as many as 4,628 were detected with the infection. During the same period, of the 60,448 pregnant women tested for HIV, 241 were detected with the virus, said Dr Ashok Nandapurkar, District Civil Surgeon.,Kalyani Patil, District Programme Officer, Maharashtra State AIDS Control Programme (MSACS), said rate of HIV transmission has declined over the past few years. While it was 8.1 per cent in 2009-10 and 5.8 per cent in 2010-11, the rate dipped to 4.1 per cent in 2011-12. ""We have now enrolled private hospitals in the programme and 31 such centres also conduct HIV detection tests,"" said Patil.,With a focus on early HIV detection, officer said they have registered 8,169 female sex workers, 5,728 men having sex with men, 311 injecting drug users, one lakh truckers and 64,975 migrants under the programme. Patil said services like tests of sexually transmitted infections, free condoms and HIV detection tests are provided under the programme.,Meanwhile, to mark the World AIDS Day on December 1, several rallies, free medical tests and workshops will be conducted in the city. Bollywood stars Shahid Kapoor and Sonakshi Sinha will participate in a campaign offering free HIV test on November 30.,A rally will be taken out from Shaniwar Wada to B J Medical College ground on December 1, following which a workshop will be held to provide training on the new triple drug regimen to be administered to HIV positive mothers to prevent transmission of infection to their infants. Additional District Collector Ganesh Patil said free medical tests to detect HIV will be conducted at 10 places in the city on November 30.,The launch of the triple drug regimen for HIV positive mothers that was scheduled for December 1 will now take place on January 1 next year. Newsline had first reported in October this year that HIV infected pregnant women would be given a three drug regimen to cut the risk of transmission of the virus to newborns. ,Instead of a single drug, the cocktail will now include lamivudine, efavirenz and tenofovir, said Dr Ramesh Bhosale, Head, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology , B J Medical College. The triple drug regimen has to be taken during pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding regardless of CD4 count or clinical stages of the disease.

,
The number of HIV-AIDS cases in Chandigarh has witnessed a decline. As per the State AIDS Control Society (SACS) this year, 75 AIDS cases have been reported from the city till October this year as opposed to 122 cases in 2012.,The total number of cases reported in the city is 647, which includes people from the neighbouring states as well. The residents of Chandigarh constitute only 11 per cent of the total cases. Haryana, followed by Punjab, constitutes the majority of AIDS cases reported in Chandigarh. Out of 647 total AIDS cases reported in Chandigarh till October this year, 320 are from Haryana and 210 from Punjab.,Also, as per the Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centre, PGI has 3,239 patients of which only 364 (11.23%) are from Chandigarh, while the rest are from neighbouring states.,Further, the major cause of HIV in Chandigarh is unsafe sex. ""Unprotected sex is the reason behind 89 per cent HIV cases in the city. It is a major threat and more awareness is needed among high risk groups,"" said Dr Vanita Gupta, Director of State AIDS Control Society (SACS).,The information was shared during the HIV-AIDS-cum-curtain raiser for AIDSCON-3 held by the States AIDS Control society. The conference was chaired by Home-cum-Health Secretary Anil Kumar.,As per SACS data, the number has reduced to 0.21 per cent this years in comparison to the national prevalence of 0.36 per cent.,Anil Kumar talked about the availability of safe blood in the community. ""The HIV positivity amongst blood donors is very low at 0.07 per cent, which ensures that safe blood is available to the community,"" he said.,According to the HIV Sentinel Surveillance, HIV prevalence has shown a decline in infection in Chandigarh. Among female sex workers it has declined from 0.67 per cent (2006) to 0 per cent (2011), while amongst men having sex with men (MSM) it has come down from 4.80 per cent (2006) to 0.40 per cent (2011) and amongst Intravenous Drug Users it has declined from 17.60 per cent (2006) to 7.20 per cent (2011).,As per Dr Vanita Gupta, Director, State AIDS Control Society (SACS), the new case detection of HIV has declined. ""More cases are being tested, but fewer cases are being found positive. In 2009, 22,253 general clients were tested and 5 per cent were positive. In 2012, more than 40,000 cases were tested and only 2 per cent were found positive."",The new case detection among pregnant women has also declined. In 2009, over 20,000 pregnant women were tested and 68 (0.33%) were positive, while in 2012, the number of positive cases declined from 22,000 to 47. ,,,The State AIDS Control Society (SACS) will launch a new programme 'Integrated Biological Behaviour Surveillance' (IBBS) in January, under which high-risk groups will be interviewed and behavioural indicators collected. The high-risk groups include sex workers, intravenous drug users, men having sex with men.,The national Integrated Biological and Behavioural Surveillance (IBBS) is a project of the Department of AIDS Control, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare under the central government and will be implemented with the support of eight regional institutes, 31 SACS and development partners across the country.,Anil Kumar, UT Home-Cum-Health Secretary announced during the curtain raiser of AIDSCON- 3,  that the UT health department will start the IBBS programme by January next year.,Dr Vanita Gupta, SACS director said, ""The objective of National IBBS is to generate evidence on HIV prevalence and risk behaviours among high-risk groups, male migrants and spouses of male migrants. Under the programme, people in the high-risk groups will be interviewed, including those who have HIV and those who do not."",Further, the study will help analyse and understand HIV-related vulnerabilities and risk profiles among key risk groups in different regions by linking behaviours with biological findings.

Availability of high quality, affordable and patient-friendly Anti-retroviral (ARV) drugs has played a vital role in combating spread of HIV-AIDS, say experts.,Dr Sunil Jain, chief pharmacist at AIIMS, said, ""Indian pharma companies are self-sufficient to handle the HIV menace in the country. We hope they continue producing quality-assured medicines as they are the lifeline for developing and under-developed countries. In no way should quality be compromised."",He added, ""The new therapies in the form of Fixed Dose Combinations have become better, more effective, easier to take and tolerate, thus improving patient compliance. Patients are now paying an amount that is seven times less as compared to a decade ago when a handful of multinational companies manufactured and supplied such life-saving drugs."",""We have a large poor population and so the industry has had a huge opportunity to target the bottom of the pyramid by making low-cost high quality drugs available."" ,""Over the previous decade, India's efforts in the AIDS response have reduced,"" said Dr N K Arora, Executive Director of the INCLEN Trust.,According to Monica Mendiratta, General Secretary of Drishtikon, an NGO working for AIDS prevention, ""Despite the progress made in containing HIV-AIDS, approximately 50 per cent people who need treatment in India still do not have access to these drugs. There needs to be an increased level of awareness about the low cost treatment options provided by the government along with more effective prevention campaigns."",Earlier during a press conference, Dr Vanita Gupta, Project Director, State AIDS Control Society, Chandigarh, assured that the city had enough ARVs  at various Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres.

,

,

,


,
Fresh hopes for an HIV/AIDS vaccine have emerged with the discovery of antibodies that can thwart the virus. Imagining a world without AIDS is a distinct possibility, say scientists who were in New Delhi for a two-day scientific group meeting of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative.,Dr Wayne Koff, chief scientific officer in IAVI and a leading figure in the AIDS vaccine research, said scientists have isolated, from HIV-positive donors around the world, a number of antibodies capable of blocking a broad spectrum of HIV variants.  Only some infected people produce these antibodies and it takes the body three years to start doing so. Scientists say the vaccine developed has to give people the right kind of HIV protein that ""instructs"" the body how to make these antibodies. ,""Scientists have mapped the structure of the protein that encases HIV's critical genetic information, a development that could eventually lead to new drugs to fight AIDS. We now understand what the HIV protein looks like, what the weaknesses are, and where the antibodies can bind them to neutralise the virus,"" Koff said.,When the antibodies were first isolated from donors, IAVI set out on a worldwide hunt under a project called 'Protocol G'. In India it was undertaken by an HIV vaccine design programme set up by IAVI and the New Delhi-based Translational Health Science and Technology Institute.,Researchers studied 1,800 samples across the world. ""In India, THSTI collected blood samples from 200 HIV-infected persons (who are not on any treatment) and conducted the first round of screening,"" said Dr Sudhanshu Vrati, head of THSTI's vaccine and infectious disease research centre. ""Initial results have picked up four such broadly neutralising antibodies,"" Vrati added.,The goal is to isolate antibodies that are broadly effective against the HIV subtype predominant in India, said Dr Rajat Goyal, IAVI country director, India.

People infected with the Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may be at an increased risk of heart disease, a new research has warned.,It is well known that patients with HIV have a high incidence of structural heart disease (mainly diastolic dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension) but the reason is not clear, according to Dr Nieves Montoro from Madrid, Spain.,The new study included 65 HIV patients (63 per cent male, average age 48 years) who had dyspnoea (shortness of breath).,The stage of HIV was determined by measuring the CD4 count and their opportunistic diseases. Also, the viral blood load was determined.,Patients had a transthoracic echocardiogram to assess whether they had structural heart disease (ventricular hypertrophy, systolic or diastolic dysfunction, or pulmonary hypertension).,The following cardiovascular risk factors were assessed: hypertension, diabetes, smoking status, dyslipidemia and renal failure.,Nearly half of patients (47%) had some form of structural heart disease, mainly left ventricular hypertrophy, left ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension and signs of right ventricle failure.,Patients with a positive blood viral load had a significantly higher incidence of structural heart disease than those with an undetectable load, independent of their cardiovascular risk profile or type of antiretroviral therapy.,""We found that half of HIV patients with dyspnea had echocardiographic evidence of structural heart disease. Our most interesting finding was that patients with a positive blood viral load had a significantly higher incidence of structural heart disease.,""In fact, having a detectable blood viral load nearly doubled the prevalence of heart disease, suggesting that HIV itself might be an independent causal agent,"" Montoro said.,The amount of structural heart disease was not affected by whether or not the patient had AIDS, their gender, age, or presence of cardiovascular risk factors.,""Our study shows an association between the presence of the virus in the blood and cardiac disease. These findings open the door to the hypothesis that HIV is involved in the aetiology of cardiac damage,"" Montoro said.,Our findings show that having any detectable level of virus in the blood nearly doubles the risk of heart disease,"" she added.,The study was presented at the annual meeting of the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging (EACVI) in Istanbul, Turkey.

The Uttar Pradesh State AIDS Control Society (UPSACS) will track migrant population in five districts as part of a national programme to check the prevalence of HIV among migrants.,As part of the pilot project, the focus will be on five high-risk districts with migrant population — Azamgarh, Gorakhpur, Jaunpur, Maharajganj and Allahabad. ,These districts are among a total of 13 in Bihar, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Orissa where the project is being implemented. As part of the project, 'source destination corridors' — having a high migrant movement — have been identified between some of these districts. ,""We have received information from Surat (Gujarat) and Thane (Maharashtra) about the presence of HIV positive migrants from the five Uttar Pradesh districts,"" said Priti Kumari, Joint Director (Target Intervention), UPSACS.,""There are many HIV positive persons in Surat and Thane who originally belong to one of the five UP districts. Most of them are in touch with district hospitals, NGOs and testing centres in Surat and Thane. ,As part of their treatment or counselling, they are supposed to report to these centres after a fixed gap but many a time, they vanish without a word. This is where this programme comes in,"" Priti said.,""So, when such a person is identified in Surat, for example, the Gujarat AIDS society will inform the National AIDS Control Society (NACO) which, in turn, will inform us, as these people often return home,"" she said, adding, ""Our role will be to link the person back to the system."",To enable speedy exchange of information on such people, a computerised tracking system — already in place in Gujarat and Maharashtra — will be installed at the state and district level.,As per NACO, three per cent of 314 million migrant population (based on 2001 census) of the country is HIV positive while HIV prevalence in India among the general population stands at 0.40 per cent.

Targetted intervention programmes have helped bring down the rate of HIV prevalence among the high risk group of men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgenders across the state. Yet, the HIV prevalence among these groups is still 14 per cent. With the Supreme Court declaring homosexuality illegal, the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) hopes it will not impact the HIV prevention programme.,One of the 30,000-odd people registered with the MSACS as MSM and transgenders, 3,400 are from Pune. ,Avsharan Kaur, Joint Director, MSACS, for targetted intervention programmes, told Newsline that it was mainly the high-risk group of MSM, transgenders and female sex workers that HIV prevention programmes were planned. ""Hence, while 30,000 of them are under the programme, it is likely that there are many more in the private sector,"" she said.,It is difficult for this community to 'come out' as they face harassment and are ridiculed by society. ""Transgenders are the worst affected as they do not get employment,"" said Kaur, adding that the health department faced a huge challenge to reach out to these groups. ,While HIV prevention programmes will continue, officials fear it may be a more challenging task to address their needs as they will not declare their status. ""For transgenders, who are subjected to ridicule, their option for survival is usually sex work. Here's why our programmes have been successful as condoms are given to everyone, HIV tests are conducted so that the viral transmission can be curtailed,"" Kaur said. ,The MSM group is tested for HIV once in every six months and condoms are distributed regularly. In Pune, the demand is nearly 12,000 condoms every month while it is 7,000 in Pimpri-Chinchwad, according to Bindumadhav Khire, president of the Sampathik Trust that receives funding from MSACS and Alliance India to conduct HIV prevention programmes among MSMs. ""We identify them via peer educators at various places in the city, like Swargate, Marketyard, Yerawada, Chinchwad and Bhosari,"" he added.,,Souvik Ghosh, who is from Kolkata and has been working at an IT firm in Pune for the last three years, does not feel ashamed in disclosing his identity. ""I am 'out' to certain members of my family, colleagues at workplace and have been in a relationship for some years now. I am surviving as an independent citizen of this country, have a good career and, yes, looking out for a soulmate. Please don't call us criminals..."" he urged. Souvik and others like him openly disclose their status but there are several who may now prefer to keep their gay identity as a secret, says Bindumadhav Khire, president of the Sampathik Trust. ""There are some 100 gay friends who connect via Facebook but after the SC verdict it is unsure whether they will remain so open,"" he adds. Psychiatrists too feel that the SC verdict was disappointing. ""So many parents find it difficult to accept their child who has a different sexual orientation and it can create mental health issues when they are now called criminals,"" says psychiatrist Dr Kaustubh Jog, who along with Dr Bhushan Shukla, Dr D K Shirole and others was signatory to the affidavit submitted in the SC that said homosexuality is not a disease.

The state is likely to get 20 additional Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centres and around 100 linked-ART centres for treating acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients by the end of this financial year. ,So far, the Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (MSACS), an organisation formed for the treatment and control of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-AIDS, has set up 70 ART and 132 linked-ART centres for AIDS patients in districts across the state. ,From setting up three ART centres in 2004 to 70 this year, MSACS has provided HIV care services to 1.7 lakh patients. ,""Through gap analysis, we realised that there was a need for additional centres. Since this treatment is needed on a regular basis, it is difficult for patients to travel long distances. Therefore more centres will be set up in areas reflecting a higher count of patients,"" said Dr Swapnali K, joint director for ART centers in MSACS. ,""The intervention programme has catered to sex workers, migrant workers and truck drivers who adopt little preventive measures,"" Swapnali said.,Currently there are five centres in and around Mumbai, such as Bhiwandi, Navi M]umbai, Kalwa, Thane and Ulhar. Inclusion of three more centres in Dombivali, Mira Bhayander and Kalyan, will take the total count to eight. ,While the new ART centres will provide all the necessary treatment to AIDS patients, linked centres will only have support system. It will not be equipped to handle full-fledged therapy. ,Since 1997, India has reflected an overall reduction by 57 per cent in new HIV infections.,However, according to MSACS, they have not been able to reach out to all patients for regular treatment. According to National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), an estimated 2.31 million people are infected with HIV in the country out of which women account for 40 per cent of the cases. ,Data provided by MSACS show 47,538 HIV-AIDS cases have been detected in the state this year — a dip from 57,075 cases reported last year.,,
